## Why Did We Choose DHL Express?

As Taiwan is an island, it's hard to find a cheapest and good service shipping company to ship all over the world. We compared lots of shipping companies and found that DHL is suitable for us. Fast and good service. Though it's expensive, we don't take any profit from it. The fee for shipping is different from zone to zone, please check this page and the payment page for more info.
