## RETURNS

### To Qualify for a Return

The ZenCleanz return and refund policy allows customers to return products within **seven (7) days of delivery** if they change their mind.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- The item must be **unused and unopened**
- Must be in the same condition it was received
- Must be in the original packaging

**Important Shipping Fee Notes:**
- If the order initially received free shipping, the shipping cost will be deducted from the refund
- If only part of an order is returned and the new total (original amount minus the return) falls below the threshold for free shipping, the customer will be responsible for the shipping charges that would have applied if the order had not qualified for free shipping. This amount will also be deducted from the refund

**Change of Mind Before Shipping:**

If someone changes their mind after ordering, they should contact customer service at **customer.service@zencleanz.com** as soon as possible to start the process of a refund. However, if the products are already in route, the return will be processed by the logistics carrier. Imposed fees by the logistics carrier for the return will be deducted from the refund.

- If the return is only part of an order and if the new order total amount (original minus the return) falls below the free shipping offer by returning it, the customer will be responsible for the shipping charges that would have been incurred had the order not received free shipping. This amount will be deducted from the refund
