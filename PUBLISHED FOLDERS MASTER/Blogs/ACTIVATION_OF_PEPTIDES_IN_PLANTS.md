## Unlocking the Power of Nature: How a 3-Year Fermentation Process Activates Peptides in Plants

In the world of health and wellness, plant-based products are increasingly sought after for their ability to promote vitality and longevity. Among these, fermented plant-based products have gained considerable attention due to their enhanced nutritional value, digestibility, and bioavailability. While the benefits of fermentation are well recognized, what makes 3-year fermented plant enzymes so exceptional lies in the deep biochemical changes that occur during the extended fermentation process. In particular, the activation of peptides is one of the most crucial transformations that takes place.

Peptides, short chains of amino acids, play a key role in numerous biological functions, from promoting immune health to aiding in tissue repair and regeneration. Through the long fermentation process, these peptides are activated, broken down, and synthesized into new forms, greatly enhancing the plant’s nutritional and therapeutic properties. This blog post will explore how a three-year fermentation process activates peptides in all plants, unlocking their full potential for human health and wellness.

Peptides are small chains of amino acids—organic compounds that serve as the building blocks of proteins. They play an essential role in many physiological processes, including immune function, hormonal balance, skin repair, and muscle recovery. The activation of peptides is particularly important in the context of plant-based fermentation, as it greatly enhances the bioavailability of the beneficial compounds present in plants.

While the human body is capable of synthesizing certain peptides, others must be obtained from external sources, such as the food we consume. However, the peptides present in raw, unfermented plants are often bound up in larger proteins and complex structures that are difficult for the body to access. This is where fermentation, particularly the long, slow process of 3-year fermentation, comes into play.

During fermentation, natural microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeast, break down complex proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids, a process known as protein hydrolysis. This breakdown of larger proteins into smaller, bioavailable peptides significantly enhances the nutritional profile of the fermented plant material.

### The Role of Fermentation in Peptide Activation

Fermentation is a natural process in which microorganisms break down organic substances, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, into simpler compounds. It is often used to preserve food, but its benefits extend far beyond that. Through fermentation, the biochemical composition of plant-based foods changes dramatically, unlocking new nutrients, enhancing flavors, and improving digestibility.

In the context of plant-based fermentation, peptides are activated through a combination of enzymatic activity, microbial fermentation, and the natural aging process. Specifically, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and acetic acid bacteria work synergistically during fermentation to break down proteins and release peptides in their active forms. A 3-year fermentation process takes this a step further, allowing ample time for these peptides to be fully activated, refined, and enriched.

## Stage 1: Yeast Fermentation – Breaking Down Proteins

The first stage of a 3-year fermentation process typically involves yeast fermentation. Yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are responsible for breaking down carbohydrates (like sugars) into alcohol and carbon dioxide. However, yeasts also secrete enzymes that begin the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides.

Proteins in raw plants are often tightly packed in a way that makes them difficult for the human body to access. Yeast enzymes such as proteases start the process of hydrolysis, cleaving larger protein molecules into smaller peptide fragments. These initial peptide chains may not yet be biologically active, but they begin the crucial process of protein breakdown.

At this stage, plant-based proteins begin their transformation into smaller, more digestible peptides that can be further acted upon in subsequent stages of fermentation.

## Stage 2: Acetic Acid Bacteria Fermentation – Enhancing Peptide Breakdown

After the initial yeast fermentation, acetic acid bacteria (AAB) take over in the second stage of the fermentation process. These bacteria, such as Acetobacter and Gluconobacter, convert alcohols into organic acids, primarily acetic acid. As the pH of the fermenting mixture decreases due to the production of acetic acid, it creates an ideal environment for the further breakdown of proteins and peptides.

At this point, proteins continue to break down, and the peptide chains formed in the yeast stage become shorter and more specialized. During this phase, the action of the acetic acid bacteria further refines the peptides, increasing the concentration of bioactive peptides that contribute to the nutritional value of the final product. These peptides are now more readily available for absorption by the human digestive system.

## Stage 3: Lactic Acid Bacteria Fermentation – Peptide Refinement

The third stage of fermentation involves the action of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These bacteria convert carbohydrates (sugars) into lactic acid, further lowering the pH and creating an acidic environment that enhances the breakdown of proteins into smaller, functional peptides.

At this stage, peptides begin to take on their bioactive form, and specific peptides that were previously hidden in the plant matrix start to be liberated. These peptides are often much smaller than those generated in earlier stages, making them easier for the human body to absorb and utilize. Some of the peptides produced in this phase have specific functions, such as acting as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, or even prebiotics, which support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

The lactic acid bacteria fermentation stage is critical in activating plant-based peptides because it produces a peptide profile rich in nutrients that the body can efficiently absorb and use.

## Stage 4: Chelation / Compound Enzyme Chelation by Patented Symbiosis #13

The final stage of a 3-year fermentation process is the chelation and compound enzyme chelation process, particularly using a specialized technique known as Symbiosis #13. This step is what truly sets long fermentation apart from shorter fermentation processes. Symbiosis #13 refers to a patented symbiotic relationship between specific enzymes, organic acids, and microbes that enhances the stability and bioavailability of the activated peptides and other nutrients in the final product.

During this stage, the peptides, amino acids, and minerals released during the earlier stages of fermentation are further chelated (bound to organic molecules) to stabilize them and enhance their effectiveness. Chelation is particularly important because it binds metal ions like iron, magnesium, and zinc to peptides and organic acids, preventing them from reacting with other compounds in the product and ensuring they remain bioavailable for absorption.

This final step not only enhances the stability of the peptides but also preserves the nutrient density of the fermented plant product, ensuring that the activated peptides are in their most bioavailable and effective form.

## How the 3-Year Fermentation Process Activates Peptides in Plants

A 3-year fermentation process allows for the full activation and breakdown of plant proteins into their smallest, most bioavailable peptide forms. The long aging period is essential because it gives the microorganisms ample time to break down proteins and synthesize peptides with specific health-promoting properties.

**During the three-year fermentation process**: 

Proteins are broken down into smaller peptides through enzymatic activity from yeast, acetic acid bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria.

Bioactive peptides are created, which contribute to numerous health benefits such as improved immune function, reduced inflammation, enhanced digestion, and better skin health.

## Minerals are chelated by organic acids and peptides, making them more stable and bioavailable.

Nutrient content is enhanced as the peptides become more accessible to the human body, improving their therapeutic potential.

This three-year period is crucial because it allows for the complete transformation of plant proteins into bioactive peptides that would otherwise remain dormant or inaccessible. The combination of fermentation time, microbial action, and enzyme chelation results in a product that is not only highly nutritious but also incredibly beneficial for human health.
