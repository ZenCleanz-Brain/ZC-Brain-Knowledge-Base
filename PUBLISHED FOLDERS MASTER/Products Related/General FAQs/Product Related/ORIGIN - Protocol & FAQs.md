# ZENCLEANZ ORIGIN BUNDLE
## 30-Day Kidney & Bladder Revitalizor

> *"The journey back to innocence is the path of joy and spontaneity, the way back home, our origin."*

---

## Philosophy

As life unfolds, layers begin to form through expectations, responsibilities, roles we learn to play. Slowly, we drift from the spontaneous joy that once animated our every step. But innocence isn't something we grow out of. It's something we can return to; not by becoming naïve, but by remembering. To return to innocence is to peel back what was never truly ours: The judgments, the fears, the stories of who we should be.

### And in that space, we rediscover something original:

- A joy that bubbles without reason
- A curiosity that sees beauty in the ordinary
- A playfulness that needs no permission

Spontaneity is the way. It bypasses the mind and reconnects us with the breath of the moment. It's the body's way of saying, "I remember how to dance with life."

This path doesn't reject wisdom. It weaves it into freedom. We don't lose what we've learned, we simply stop letting it define us. We reclaim what was never truly lost: the lightness, the laughter, the living spark.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Additional Tips for Doing Origin

#### Preparation

- **Stop** smoking, drinking alcohol or caffeine. Coffee and caffeinated tea are acidifying and should be avoided or minimized
- **Focus** on nutritious antioxidant-rich foods such as apples, grapes, berries, kale, spinach, onion, and garlic. Do a web search for more
- **Limit** salt and protein intake, especially animal protein such as meat, eggs, and dairy
- **Avoid** high-sugar and processed foods
- **Keep** a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing ~ the more details the better
- There is a required expiration date listed on each kit. If unopened, the kits will be usable long after the expiration date

#### During and After

- **Hydration:** Be sure to drink at least 2-3 liters/quarts daily. Cool or cold water can shock the body, requiring energy to warm it. The warm water helps disperse the enzymes throughout an empty stomach to absorb them more quickly

- **Stress Management:** Try to release yourself from unnecessary stress, focus on a positive emotional state, and get adequate sleep (7-8 hrs) throughout the program. Ask yourself, "How can I reduce my daily stress?" Healthy kidneys start with a healthy mindset!

- **Exercise:** Aerobic exercises, yoga, and Qi Gong are some recommended exercises

- **First Time Use:** We recommend doing the ORIGIN as a standalone for the first time, so that its effects on the body can be fully appreciated. Thereafter, feel free to add in other liquid enzymes, powders, and capsules

- **Common Effects:** Users report more frequent urination in the beginning; subsiding over time. Some state that their lower back pain (kidney related) improves, they have more energy, and better sleep

- **Medications:** Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes, and check with your doctor if necessary

- **Advanced Usage:** You may take 2 ORIGIN bundles at a time. Space out the dosing by at least 60 minutes. If someone has a weak system and low vitality, we suggest that the Jîng capsules be taken 2 or 3 times daily. (An additional purchase of the Jîng is required.) Reduce dosing when energy flow returns

### Does the Origin Kill Parasites?

The ORIGIN doesn't kill parasites. Parasites are only able to thrive in a stagnant environment. In addition to detoxing and strengthening the kidneys using the ORIGIN, doing the FORGIVE liver detox after the ONE intestinal detox helps to begin to alkalize the intestines through improved bile flow. The FLOW helps detox the lymph and blood and the ORIGIN helps to strengthen and cleanse the kidneys. Over time, continual detoxing and a supportive healthful lifestyle will help restore the system's integrity and alkalinity, making the body an unwelcome environment for parasites.

### Are There Any Conditions Where I Should NOT Do the Origin Kidney Bundle?

**⚠️ JÎNG should NOT be taken by anyone under 8 years old.** It is not a supplement for children; some adaptogens and B Complex must be monitored in such a young person. 

**Safe alternatives for children:** Heal children with food and ZenCleanz Ambrosia, Hygieia, Inca, Aztec, Fiber Crystals, Black Vacuum, and Quantum Particles, all of which are safe choices. 

If you have any concerns, please consult your doctor or healthcare provider.

### May I Do the Origin Detox if I Am Pregnant or Nursing?

**YES!** The ORIGIN bundle includes beneficial enzymes that will support the health of both the mother and baby. ZenCleanz products are rich in 100% bioavailable nutrients, promoting optimal cellular nutrition, naturally fermented, derived from a variety of fruits and vegetables, which effectively provide essential nutrients during pregnancy, enhance the body's resilience, improve water metabolism, and are suitable for continued use after childbirth.

**📝 NOTE:** If taking ZenCleanz liquid enzymes for the first time, starting after the third month of pregnancy is recommended. If you have been drinking enzymes before the pregnancy, you may continue to consume them throughout the pregnancy.

## Other Things to Consider

### Daily Enzyme Benefits

Taking ZenCleanz enzymes daily helps cleanse and nourish the body's cells on a systemic level, complementing more targeted detox kits. Incorporating these energetic enzymes into a healthful lifestyle significantly supports the ongoing benefits of detoxification and prepares the body for future cleansing efforts.

All liquid enzymes provide the advantages of long-term fermented, completely pre-digested enzymes, ensuring 100% bioavailable nutrients that continuously break down layers of congestion in the body. Each liquid enzyme has a unique profile, so we encourage everyone to explore the properties of each one, select the enzyme(s) that resonate with them, and try a variety for optimal results. 

**For kidney health**, customers often choose Aztec, Inca, and Jîng tablets.

### Sample Schedule for System Maintenance

- 25-30 ml / 5-6 tsp, 1-3x daily
