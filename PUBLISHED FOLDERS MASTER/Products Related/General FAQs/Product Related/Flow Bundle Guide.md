## Opening Reflection

*"Courageously And Peacefully, Surrender With Your Eyes Closed. Enter The Flow Of Life."*

There is a current moving through all things - quiet, steady, alive. Whether we resist it or relax into it, the flow continues. But something shifts when we choose to surrender - not from fear, but from trust.

In a world obsessed with control, surrender can feel like weakness. But the Real Courage Lies In Softening. In unclenching the fists. In breathing into the unknown and saying, I am ready to be guided. To surrender with your eyes closed is not to be blind, it is to see with something deeper. It is to listen to the silent wisdom beneath the noise. To feel the river of life carrying you. Even when you don't know what's around the bend.

This isn't passive. It's presence. It's the grace to step forward without needing all the answers. To release the need to force and instead allow yourself to be moved. Moved by the rhythm that already lives in you. The same rhythm that guides the tides, the stars, the seasons. Life does not ask you to control it. It asks you to dance with it.

When you surrender, not only do you lighten your load, but you also unlock your natural resilience, your clarity, your calm. You remember that you are not separate from the flow, you are part of it. And the more you trust it, the more life begins to feel like home again. So, close your eyes, not to escape, but to come closer. Let go, not to fall, but to rise in a new way. Breathe. Soften. Trust. The flow knows. And you were never meant to fight it. You were born to move with it.

## Guided Protocol for Inner Rhythm with the ZENCLEANZ FLOW BUNDLE

A rhythm. A ritual. A return to flow.

This is not just a protocol – it's a pulse. A gentle activation of your inner rivers. Every enzyme in your FLOW kit is designed to meet your body where it's at, helping you soften stagnation, clear inner traffic, and reawaken circulation from the inside out.

### Get Started

There is no rigid clock. Simply choose times that harmonize with your rhythm and best fit your schedule. The following is a recommended order but do what is best for you. Remember, all enzymes work best on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before or 60 minutes after food.

---

### Morning: NATTOBLAST

NattoBlast-1 Sachet
Pour into 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water
Stir, sip, and let it awaken your bloodstream like sunlight through branches.

---

### Mid-Morning: MYCELIA

Take 25ml(5tsp)
Pour into 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water
Feel it ground you, cool inflammation, and infuse your system with the quiet wisdom of medicinal mushrooms.

---

### Mid-Afternoon: SPARK

Before your Spark, give your lymph a gentle nudge - use a dry brush to awaken the skin and stimulate flow.

**Dosage:** Take 25ml (5 tsp). Pour into 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water and feel the inner fire build.

You may feel warmth, tingles, or a rush of energy. That is your body coming back online. It's working.

#### Various Effects You May Feel

Red cheeks. Tingles. Pulses. Heat. Itching. Joyful buzzing in your veins. Do not be alarmed. This is a natural product that enhances blood circulation and flow to dislodge and flush toxins throughout the body.

- **Prefer to slow the ride?** Dilute with more warm water or sip the mixture over an hour or two.
- **Sensitive stomach?** Take with a light meal.
- **⚠️ NOT for use during pregnancy.**
- Do not exceed 25ml (5 tsp) daily.

Start small. Stay upright. And if you feel the urge to high-five the universe - go for it.

#### After the Rush

Help your body release what's moving.

Sweat it out in a sauna, hot bath, brisk walk, or gentle stretch combined with deep breathing and let the flow complete its cycle.

---

### Evening: NATTOBLAST

**NattoBlast - 1 Sachet**  
Pour into 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water

Let it carry you into the night with open vessels and quiet strength.

**This isn't just circulation - it's transformation. Flow is life. And now, you're moving with it.**

## Frequently Asked Questions and Other Considerations for the FLOW Bundle

### Additional Tips for Doing a FLOW Kit

#### Preparation

- Stop smoking and do not drink alcohol or caffeine for the duration of the cleanse.
- Endeavor to eat at consistent times and avoid eating after 7 pm.
- Focus on whole foods, especially blood-cleansing foods such as bitter, astringent, and naturally sweet foods.
- Avoid salty, spicy, and refined sugar foods and all processed foods.
- Focus on alkaline foods/drinks and increase the number of vegetables or maintain a vegetarian diet, if possible.
- Drink at least 2 liters of clean warm water per day. Cool or cold water can shock the body, requiring energy to warm it. The warm water helps disperse the enzymes throughout an empty stomach to absorb them more quickly.
- Keep a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing – the more details the better.
- There is a required expiration date listed on each kit. If unopened, the kits will be usable long after the expiration date.

#### During and After

- Dry skin brush before you take the Spark blend and get into a sauna (if you have access to one) after the rushing feeling is over (if it happens). If there is no sauna access, take a hot mineral bath or exercise. Boosting circulation and lymph flow through dry brushing, then sweating (sauna or hot bath) is a great way to augment this cleanse.

- We recommend doing the FLOW as a standalone for the first time, so that its effects on the body can be fully appreciated. Thereafter, feel free to add in other liquid enzymes, powders, and capsules.

- Users report feeling lighter and clearer. It is common to experience detoxification reactions, such as feelings of fullness, aches or pains, skin eruptions, or rashes, as your body begins to find balance. Keep in mind that circulation will improve in areas that have been stagnant, and any detoxification symptoms you experience are a reflection of your body working towards achieving balance.

- Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes, and check with your doctor if necessary.

- You may do back-to-back FLOW bundles.

### Additional Tips for Doing a FLOW Bundle

1. Wear loose fitting clothing in layers when taking the Spark Blend.
2. Consider following the Spark Blend drink with another glass of warm water to take the edge off the response.
3. Cleansing is a beautiful time to focus on self-care.
4. Support protocols suggested during this cleanse include:
   - Dry skin brushing
   - Sauna
   - Bouncing movement daily, such as walking, rebounding, or vibration plate
   - Stretching, Yoga, Qi Gong, and Tai-Chi
   - Lymphatic drainage massage
   - Sleep 7-8 hours a night, more if needed

### Note on the Spark Blend

The Spark blend boosts circulation all over the body. Please do not be alarmed. The ginger and pepper contained in this blend are meant to increase flow throughout the body and flush toxicity. Your skin may have a rushing feeling, itch, tingle, become red, feel "full," and you may feel an increased pulsation. These sensations may sometimes be intense but are common and will pass in an hour or so. This is an opportunity to feel an expansiveness with the increased circulation and not a cause for alarm. Sometimes there are no noticeable reactions, but the blend is still working. After this time, you may also get a chill. This, too, is common and would be an excellent time to get into a sauna or hot mineral bath.

---

### May I take the FLOW while menstruating?

A woman's monthly cycle serves as a natural form of detoxification, so it is advisable to consider waiting until at least the third day of the cycle, or longer, depending on individual responses to the cycle, before starting any detox programs. Some women experience difficult periods and may choose to wait until their cycle has completely ended. Ultimately, this decision is a personal preference. Important to note that the FLOW increases blood flow, so if there are apprehensions about a possible increase while menstruating, wait until your cycle ends.

---

### Does the FLOW kill parasites?

The FLOW doesn't kill parasites. Parasites are only able to thrive in a stagnant environment. In addition to detoxing and strengthening the lymph and blood using the FLOW, doing the FORGIVE liver detox after the ONE intestinal detox helps to begin to alkalize the intestines through improved bile flow. The INSPIRE helps detox and strengthen the lungs, and the ORIGIN helps to strengthen and cleanse the kidneys. Over time, continual detoxing and a supportive healthful lifestyle will help restore the system's integrity and alkalinity, making the body an unwelcome environment for parasites.

---

### Are there any conditions where I should not do the FLOW bundle?

If you are pregnant, or planning to be, or nursing. If you have any concerns, please consult your doctor or healthcare provider.

---

### May I do the FLOW if I am pregnant or nursing?

**No.** The Mycelia, Spark, and NattoBlast are not advisable for pregnant, or planning to be pregnant, or nursing women. Additionally, the ONE, FORGIVE, and Chi are not advisable for pregnant, or planning to be pregnant, women. However, the ORIGIN kit, all other liquid enzymes, and sachets are good for the mother and baby. Remember that ZenCleanz products are foods with 100% bioavailable nutrients that help cellular nutrition.

**NOTE:** If taking ZenCleanz liquid enzymes for the first time, starting after the third month of pregnancy is recommended. If you have been drinking enzymes before the pregnancy, you may continue to consume them throughout the pregnancy.

---

### Other Things to Consider

- Taking ZenCleanz enzymes daily helps cleanse and nourish the body's cells on a systemic level, complementing more targeted detox kits. Incorporating these energetic enzymes into a healthful lifestyle significantly supports the ongoing benefits of detoxification and prepares the body for future cleansing efforts.

- All liquid enzymes provide the advantages of long-term fermented, completely pre-digested enzymes, ensuring 100% bioavailable nutrients that continuously break down layers of congestion in the body. Each liquid enzyme has a unique profile, so we encourage everyone to explore the properties of each one, select the enzyme(s) that resonate with them, and try a variety for optimal results. For lymph and blood health, customers often choose any of the products in the FLOW kit which are all sold separately.

---

### A Sample Schedule for How to Take Enzymes for System Maintenance

- **This applies to any liquid enzymes:** 25-30 ml/5-6 tsp, 1-3x daily. Take in 250 ml /8.5 oz warm water. Take 30 minutes before or an hour after food.

- **Scheduling enzymes:** We suggest spreading enzyme intake throughout the day, taking one enzyme at a time, and waiting an hour or more to take another enzyme dose.

- One 25 mL/5 tsp dose of liquid enzymes once or twice daily will provide supplemental support for the body.

- Taking 3 or more doses of liquid enzymes daily boosts the repair in the body to therapeutic levels.

- Daily doses of 90 mL/18 tsp and above can allow one to fast on and feel full. We do not recommend exceeding 200 mL/40 tsp, as it may lead to overstimulation.

---

### A Little Bit About ZENCLEANZ Products

- Since we ferment 152+ plants and work with small and big farmers all over the world, it is impossible to ask them all to get the Organic Certification. Therefore, we test for over 200 substances after the process is over (heavy metals, bacteria, and chemicals like pesticides, herbicides etc.) Moreover, Taiwan's law forbids GMOs. Additionally, the factory is ISO 22000 and HACCP certified.

- All ZenCleanz products are fermented, for three years, except the FORGIVE flush drink, INSPIRE tea, and ORIGIN Jing.

---Here are the benefits of the NATTOBLAST.

Nattokinase, a powerful enzyme extracted from natto (a traditional Japanese fermented soybean dish), offers several proven and promising benefits for blood vessels and cardiovascular health.

Here’s a breakdown of its effects:
1. Dissolves Fibrin (Clot Prevention & Breakdown)
• Main Benefit: Nattokinase dissolves fibrin, a protein in blood clot formation.
• Result: Helps prevent abnormal blood clots, reducing the risk of stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and heart attacks.

2. Improves Blood Flow & Circulation
• Mechanism: By reducing fibrin and breaking down minor clots, blood flows more smoothly through vessels.
• Result: Enhances microcirculation, especially beneficial for those with poor peripheral circulation or cold extremities.

3. Lowers Blood Pressure
• How: Nattokinase may help break down excess angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which raises blood pressure.
• Result: Promotes natural blood pressure regulation.

4. Reduces Arterial Plaque Formation
• Effect: Indirectly supports arterial health by maintaining cleaner blood and preventing clot-related blockages.
• Result: May contribute to slower progression of atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries).

5. Anti-inflammatory Properties
• Impact: Chronic inflammation can damage blood vessel linings.
• Nattokinase’s role: Helps modulate inflammation, supporting vascular integrity over time.

6. Natural Thrombolytic Agent (Without Side Effects of Pharmaceuticals)
• Unlike pharmaceutical blood thinners (e.g., Warfarin), nattokinase works without significantly increasing bleeding risk (though caution is still advised).

Key Summary
Nattokinase:
• Breaks down blood clots
• Enhances circulation
• Supports healthy blood pressure
• Helps protect arterial walls
• Offers a gentler, natural alternative to chemical blood thinners

Here are the countraindications to Nattokinase:
While
nattokinase
(an enzyme extracted from fermented soybeans, natto) is generally considered safe for many people and is often used for its
blood-thinning and clot-dissolving properties
, there are some
important contraindications and cautions
to be aware of:

Contraindications
1.
Bleeding Disorders
• People with conditions like hemophilia or low platelet counts should avoid nattokinase, as it can increase bleeding risk.
2.
Use of Anticoagulant or Antiplatelet Medications
• Those taking drugs like warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, clopidogrel (Plavix), aspirin, or other blood thinners may experience
excessive bleeding
when combining them with nattokinase.
3.
Upcoming Surgery or Dental Procedures
• Because it slows clotting, it should be discontinued at least
2 weeks before surgery
to reduce bleeding risk.
4.
History of Hemorrhagic Stroke
• Nattokinase can increase the risk of further bleeding in those with a history of brain bleeding.
5.
Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
• There isn’t enough reliable safety data for these groups, so it’s best to avoid during pregnancy and lactation.

Cautions
•
Uncontrolled hypertension
: May increase bleeding risk if blood vessels are already fragile.
•
Stomach ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding
: Could worsen bleeding.
•
Combination with supplements
that thin the blood (e.g., fish oil, ginkgo biloba, garlic in high doses) may also increase bleeding risk
