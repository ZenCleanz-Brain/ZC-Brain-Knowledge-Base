## Following Your Inner Voice

*"Follow the voice within without compromising and you will inspire the world."*

From the moment we arrive, the world begins shaping us. Culture gives us identity. Education gives us structure. But somewhere along the way, we're taught to seek approval, follow expectations, and define success by standards that rarely reflect our soul. We learn to play roles. To perform. To fit in. And yet, beneath the noise of conditioning, something quieter endures, the voice within. It doesn't shout. It doesn't demand. It whispers. Constant. Clear. Uncompromising.

To follow it is not always easy. It asks us to question the rules, to disappoint expectations, to walk paths that may not yet be paved. But in doing so, we return to the rhythm of who we truly are, beyond what we were taught to be.

This kind of integrity is rare. And powerful. When you choose it, you don't just free yourself, you become a mirror for others. A reminder that it's possible to live truthfully, even in a world built on pretense. You show that authenticity is not rebellion, it is alignment. And alignment is healing for yourself, and for everyone who sees you choose it.

So let the world offer its noise. And let your voice guide you through it, unwavering, rooted, alive.

## Frequently Asked Questions and Other Considerations

### Additional Tips for Doing an INSPIRE Kit

#### Preparation

- Stop smoking, avoid second-hand smoke, air pollution, and places with poor air quality before and during the lung detox.

- Eating a mucus-free diet and focus on antioxidant-rich foods before and during the detox such as apples, blueberries, grapes, peppers, ginger, turmeric, and foods high in vitamin D such as mushrooms, eggs (if you can tolerate them), wild caught salmon, and sardines. Do a web search for more ideas.

- Coffee and caffeinated tea are acidifying and should be avoided or minimized.

- Avoid refined sugar, processed, frozen, canned, and packaged foods before and during the detox to inhibit toxin intake and allow for a deeper detox.

- Keep a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing ~ the more details the better.

#### During and After

- While on the lung cleanse, one may follow a vegan diet if they choose; dietary suggestions are simply listing foods high in vitamin D. These suggestions for before and during detoxing help prevent excess mucus buildup, allowing for deeper cleansing and initiating the rejuvenation and regeneration of the entire body and lung cells.

- Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes, and check with your doctor if necessary.

- There is a required expiration date listed on each kit. If unopened, the kits will be usable long after the expiration date.

- Drink warm water. Cool or cold water can shock the body, requiring energy to warm it. The warm water helps disperse the enzymes throughout an empty stomach to absorb them more quickly.

#### Additional Tips for Doing an INSPIRE Kit

- **For the Herbal Tea:** The ingredients of the tea are minerals and compounds from herbs, and they are not fermented. The tea is best with very warm water, not boiled, but warm enough to drink, approximately 60ºC/140ºF.

- **The ingredients in the vials** are fermented, very fragile, and sensitive to oxygenation. It is why small individual vials are in the kit.

- **Cleansing is a wonderful time to focus on self-care.** Many support protocols are suggested during the lung cleanse:
  - Get plenty of fresh air
  - Sauna
  - Movement: 30-40 minutes daily
  - Research diaphragmatic breathing exercises: Blow out air as long as possible, use a balloon to practice
  - Neti-pots
  - Inhaling essential oils
  - Percussing/vibrating the lungs to stimulate and dispel mucous
  - Hot showers: steaming the lungs
  - Acupressure
  - Sleep 7-8 hours a night, more if needed

- We recommend doing the INSPIRE as a standalone for the first time, so that its effects on the body can be fully appreciated. Thereafter, feel free to add in other liquid enzymes, powders, and capsules.

- You may take 2 INSPIRE Kits at a time. Space out the dosing of each product by at least 60 minutes; do not double up at the same time.

### What can I expect? What are possible detoxification symptoms?

The INSPIRE lung rejuvenator serves as both a lung detoxer and a strengthener. It offers a gentle detox with cumulative benefits. Strengthening the lungs allows the body to efficiently push oxygen to its farthest reaches, aiding in alkalinization and detoxification over time.

Possible detoxification symptoms may include headaches, mild cold or flu-like feelings, sniffling, coughing, runny nose, increased phlegm, a sense of dryness, and heaviness in the chest. While symptoms can vary, they generally subside as the month progresses. By the end of the cleanse, you should notice an improvement in your ability to breathe deeply and easily.

---

### Does the INSPIRE kill parasites?

The INSPIRE doesn't kill parasites. Parasites are only able to thrive in a stagnant environment. In addition to detoxing and strengthening the lungs using the INSPIRE, doing the FORGIVE liver detox after the ONE intestinal detox helps to begin to alkalize the intestines through improved bile flow. The FLOW helps detox the lymph and blood and the ORIGIN helps to strengthen and cleanse the kidneys. Over time, continual detoxing and a supportive healthful lifestyle will help restore the system's integrity and alkalinity, making the body an unwelcome environment for parasites.

---

### Are there any conditions where I should not do the INSPIRE lung detox?

INSPIRE should not be taken by anyone under 6 years of age without the supervision of a TCM doctor. If you have any concerns, please consult your doctor or healthcare provider.

---

### May I do the INSPIRE detox if I am pregnant or nursing?

The INSPIRE is **NOT recommended** during pregnancy or nursing due to the potent herbs. The ONE, FORGIVE, FLOW, Mycelia, Chi, and NattoBlast are not advisable for pregnant, or planning to be pregnant, women. However, the ORIGIN kit, all other liquid enzymes, and sachets are good for the mother and baby. Remember that ZenCleanz products are foods with 100% bioavailable nutrients that help cellular nutrition.

**NOTE:** If taking ZenCleanz liquid enzymes for the first time, starting after the third month of pregnancy is recommended. If you have been drinking enzymes before the pregnancy, you may continue to consume them throughout the pregnancy.

---

## Other Things to Consider

- Taking ZenCleanz enzymes daily helps cleanse and nourish the body's cells on a systemic level, complementing more targeted detox kits. Incorporating these energetic enzymes into a healthful lifestyle significantly supports the ongoing benefits of detoxification and prepares the body for future cleansing efforts.

- All liquid enzymes provide the advantages of long-term fermented, completely pre-digested enzymes, ensuring 100% bioavailable nutrients that continuously break down layers of congestion in the body. Each liquid enzyme has a unique profile, so we encourage everyone to explore the properties of each one, select the enzyme(s) that resonate with them, and try a variety for optimal results. For lung health, customers often choose Chi, Mycelia, and Gut Essentials.

### Sample Schedule for System Maintenance

**This applies to any liquid enzymes:** 25-30 ml/5-6 tsp, 1-3x daily. Take in 250 ml /8.5 oz warm water. Take 30 minutes before or an hour after food.

**Scheduling enzymes:** We suggest spreading enzyme intake throughout the day, taking one enzyme at a time, and waiting an hour or more to take another enzyme dose.

- One 25 mL/5 tsp dose of liquid enzymes once or twice daily will provide supplemental support for the body.
- Taking 3 or more doses of liquid enzymes daily boosts the repair in the body to therapeutic levels.
- Daily doses of 90 mL /18 tsp and above can allow one to fast on and feel full. We do not recommend exceeding 200 mL/40 tsp, as it may lead to overstimulation.

## A Little Bit About ZenCleanz Products

- Since we ferment 152+ plants and work with small and big farmers all over the world, it is impossible to ask them all to get the Organic Certification. Therefore, we test for over 200 substances after the process is over (heavy metals, bacteria, and chemicals like pesticides, herbicides etc.). Moreover, Taiwan's law forbids GMOs. Additionally, the factory is ISO 22000 and HACCP certified.

- All ZenCleanz products are fermented, for three years, except the FORGIVE flush drink, INSPIRE tea, and ORIGIN Jîng.
