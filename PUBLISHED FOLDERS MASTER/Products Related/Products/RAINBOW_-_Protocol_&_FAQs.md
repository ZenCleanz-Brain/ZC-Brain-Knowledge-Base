# ZENCLEANZ RAINBOW PROTOCOL BUNDLE 

## 7-Day Deep Synergistic Journey 

> *"SEVEN days to restore the spectrum of your being."*

---

## Philosophy

Just like light refracted through a prism reveals the full spectrum of color, RAINBOW reveals the full spectrum of your health potential, clearing, nourishing, and revitalizing every layer of your digestive, emotional, and energetic self.

**This is not a diet. Not a cleanse. Not a challenge.** It is a recalibration of your core system, a reset that clears what blocks you, so your true colors can return.

### RAINBOW is a 7-day synergistic journey that combines the most powerful ZenCleanz tools

- The deep intestinal sweep of **ONE**
- The liver and bile flow restoration of **FORGIVE**
- The microbiome rebalance of the **3 Gut Essentials**
- The liquid enzymatic life-force of **HYGIEIA**

Together, they activate every organ of digestion and detox, every metabolic channel of elimination, and every aspect of your inner ecology.

# ZENCLEANZ RAINBOW PLUS PROTOCOL BUNDLE

## 20-Day Deep Synergistic Journey

> *"A Twenty-Day Transformational Enzymatic Journey Into Your Core."*

---

## Philosophy

The RAINBOW PLUS Protocol is not just a detox, it's a 20-day catalytic reset that targets the two most essential systems for detoxification and vitality: the **Digestive Tract** and the **Biliary System - Liver & Gallbladder**. Designed for those ready to go deeper, this powerful protocol amplifies the original RAINBOW experience with higher enzyme dosages, multiple flushes, and sustained therapeutic nourishment.

### This intensive enzyme journey helps to:

- Begin to eliminate years of accumulated waste, mucoid plaque, and bile sludge
- Reignite and regenerate digestive function and enzyme potential
- Revitalize your liver metabolism and begin restoring hormonal harmony
- Develop a cleaner inner terrain that promotes a foundation for a full-body detox

The RAINBOW PLUS Protocol is your gateway to a true transformational experience. It doesn't just clear debris, it awakens the body's own intelligence and builds momentum toward deep, lasting healing. Many who walk this path report breakthroughs not only in physical health, but also in mental clarity, emotional release, and spiritual connection.

**Commit to the deep. Step into your power. Begin your transformation.**

## Gentle Guidance & Intuitive Listening for RAINBOW PLUS

### Notes for the ONE Detox

- Try your best to go through the whole protocol but if you feel nauseous or overly full, slow down — space the sachets. Try to go through at least 5–6 sachets on Day 1 and conclude with the Fiber Crystals sachet in the evening
- Be sure to complete the remaining sachets the next morning, adjust the times of the other enzymes accordingly – take them at least 30-60 minutes away from each other
- Continue gentle abdominal massages for a few more days and go out for short walks throughout the day. They are key to awakening and releasing

### Notes for the FORGIVE Detox

- If you would like, you may apply gentle abdominal massage, stretching, and rest – whatever brings your body into its presence
- Propping your head/shoulders so they are above your feet may be helpful to prevent reflux when lying down on your right side after ingesting the flush formula

### RAINBOW PLUS Protocol Notes

- If you're finding that adding any of the liquid enzymes to the enzyme packet is too sweet or too much, take it with 250ml of lukewarm water at the ½ hour instead
- Be patient. Evacuations come when the body is ready. Transit time is unique to each person
- You will have 2 - 60ml bottles of Ambrosia and 3 - 60ml bottles of Hygieia liquid enzymes remaining. You can take them the following days in 20-30 ml doses (1-3 doses daily) with 250ml (8.5 oz) of lukewarm water. Take 30 minutes before or 60 minutes after food

### When and What May I Eat/Drink to Break the Fast? (RAINBOW PLUS)

You may begin to eat the morning of day 21; starting with easily digestible food is suggested: broth (chicken or veggie), fresh green juice, fruit, and steamed veggies are good options. Avoid raw food, high sugar content fruit juices, or smoothies, especially if it is determined you have internal dampness. Go slowly with small portions; no fat the first day if possible. Over the course of the week following the detox, we suggest eating liver-friendly foods as well as eating fresh and light meals. Research online for liver friendly foods and drinks/recipes and use this opportunity to make healthful changes to your diet.

### May I Do a Warm Water or Coffee Enema? May I Do a Colonic? (RAINBOW PLUS)

We suggest that any enema or colonic be done after the first set of detox kits are completed, the first ONE and FORGIVE (day 8 or beyond) and the body has had a chance to eliminate on its own. Keep in mind that an enema and colonic only deal with the large intestines and the elimination has to travel through the small intestines as well. Additionally, a coffee enema will stain the release. Try to refrain from doing enemas too frequently during this detox protocol. As the protocol progresses, you should feel the need for one to begin to reduce.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### ⚠️ If There Is Internal Inflammation

**PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING PROTOCOL BEFORE DOING A ONE, FORGIVE, RAINBOW PROTOCOL, OR RAINBOW PLUS PROTOCOL.**

Consider taking the Mycelia liquid enzymes (or Lightseed if you have sugar issues), and the Gut Essentials (GE) - Black Vacuum, Quantum Particles, and Fiber Crystals to reduce internal inflammation. These can be taken for 3 to 4 weeks or longer. Start slowly by introducing one product at a time and monitor how your body responds for several days. Begin adding the other products in the same manner. Adjust the dosages or make changes as needed. Once symptoms shift and the person is comfortable going forward, the ONE or FORGIVE can be used. Sometimes, the FORGIVE is done before the ONE to improve the overall condition further.

#### Liquid Enzymes

The dosing for the Mycelia/Lightseed is two doses, separately, daily, at 25 mL/5 tsp with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water. Start with one dose and increase as the body adjusts.

#### The Gut Essentials

- The Quantum Particles can be taken away from food with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water daily
- The Black Vacuum should be taken with 500 mL/17 oz of warm water away from food once or twice daily
- The Fiber Crystals should be taken with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water in the evening before bedtime

Additionally, if one has issues with intestinal inflammation, it can be helpful to begin with a liver detox first. When ready to do the RAINBOW, follow the instructions for the Reverse RAINBOW later in this document.

---

### Why Consider Splitting This Kit Into Two Separate Times?

If you are concerned about losing weight, having trouble fasting for more than a day or two, or having adrenal issues, please take the time to read all the documentation to decide before attempting to complete the kit in one go. It's perfectly fine to start with the ONE kit, fast for a day or two to allow plaque to be released and then finish with the FORGIVE products a week or two later. Any remaining products after the liver flush is completed can be used daily. You can still achieve great results with either approach.

### Additional Tips for Doing a Rainbow Protocol

#### Preparation

- **Stop smoking** and do not drink alcohol or caffeine for the duration of the detox
- The enzyme detoxes are designed not to require much preparation to do them. Eating lightly for a day or two beforehand can be beneficial. Choose easily digestible foods such as soups, fruits, and steamed vegetables
- Meat tends to take longer to pass through the digestive system. You will be detoxing for a week, so additionally, preparing your mind for being with the process is wise
- **Read through the entire checklist and frequently asked questions (FAQs) FOR EACH DETOX** before attempting the RAINBOW protocol. Follow the instructions carefully
- Make sure that all the contents are in the kit. In the extremely rare instance that something is missing, contact customer care or the support team on Facebook or Telegram for more guidance on how to proceed
- **The packets are numbered.** Lay out all packets and liquid enzymes in order of the schedule and numbering of packets. **PLEASE TAKE THEM IN ORDER**
- Keep a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing ~ the more details the better

#### During and After

- We **STRONGLY recommend** keeping to a liquid diet for the days after the ONE intestinal cleanse so your body may continue to release plaque. The RAINBOW is designed to assist in this process
- **Important:** If you begin eating, the body goes into "digestion mode." Only in a fasted state will your body easily release plaque
- If you feel hungry, we suggest more ZenCleanz liquid enzymes, thin broths (chicken or veggie), Miso, raw fresh GREEN juices (no fruit or fiber), and weak herbal tea
- **Avoid** fiber, fat, and sugars, including natural sugar ingredients such as carrots, beets, honey, etc.
- You may drink more warm water throughout the day of each detox and the week of fasting
- On Day 6, we recommend only sips within 2 hours of the flush drink. You don't want a lot of water in your stomach when you drink the flush drink
- Cool or cold water can shock the body, requiring energy to warm it. The warm water helps disperse the enzymes throughout an empty stomach to absorb them more quickly
- Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes, and check with your doctor if necessary
- When using ZenCleanz enzymes with warm water, they provide whole foods that are abundant in electrolytes and deliver the necessary "charge" for the body's cells, making additional substances unnecessary during a detox
- You'll find you're full from using the enzymes provided in the kit. If by chance you "feel" hungry, we encourage exploring how much of the hunger is emotional and a state of feeling empty. The feeling of emptiness contains much wisdom if we allow ourselves to explore it
- During the days between detox sessions, you will be fasting on liquid enzymes, powders, and capsules while consuming a significant amount of water. Your body will undergo systemic detoxification
- You may experience what feels like diarrhea; however, we refer to it as normal evacuations since you are not eating solid food, and your body is eliminating fluids and toxins
- During the days between the detoxes, you may work or go to the gym, however, staying or working from home is better as you'll still be busy with the schedule and have frequent trips to the bathroom due to all of the liquid you will ingest
- Additionally, relaxing and focusing on yourself are an important part of the detoxing process
- There is a required expiration date listed on each kit. If unopened, the kits will be usable long after the expiration date

#### Additional User Tips for the Rainbow

Please see the manual/FAQs for the ONE and FORGIVE Kits for additional important and helpful details.

---

### May I Take the Rainbow While Menstruating?

A woman's monthly cycle serves as a natural form of detoxification, so it is advisable to consider waiting until at least the third day of the cycle, or longer, depending on individual responses to the cycle, before starting any detox programs. Some women experience difficult periods and may choose to wait until their cycle has completely ended. Ultimately, this decision is a personal preference.

---

### When and What May I Eat/Drink to Break the Fast?

You may begin to eat the morning of day 8 (after you have completed the detox) or day 7 around noon; starting with easily digestible food is suggested:

**Good options:**

- Broth (chicken or veggie)
- Fresh green juice
- Fruit
- Steamed veggies

**Avoid:**

- Raw food
- High sugar content fruit juices or smoothies, especially if it is determined you have internal dampness (there is a section that addresses this later in this document)

Go slowly with small portions; no fat the first day if possible. Over the course of the week following the detox, we suggest eating liver-friendly foods as well as eating fresh and light meals. Research online for liver friendly foods and drinks/recipes and use this opportunity to make healthful changes to your diet.

---

### I Am Getting a Headache; I Have Heartburn; I Have Gas and Bloating. I Feel Lightheaded; I Am Becoming Nauseous. What If I Vomit?

Detox headaches and heartburn are symptoms of toxins moving through the body/liver and will pass. Detox nausea can be from fear and/or indicating toxins moving through the liver. ALL indigestion symptoms are common when detoxing, including gas, bloating, burping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Your body works hard to break up the accumulation, and symptoms will soon slow down.

**Helpful tools include:**

- A castor oil pack (NOT on day 6 of the RAINBOW)
- Heating pad
- Abdominal massage
- Drinking more warm water
- Working with your breath to calm the body
- Light movements such as going for a walk
- A nap if you can take one

Remember, detox reactions are common, even if you have done detoxing before. Detoxing with enzymes is an amazing experience for your body, and some people experience deeper symptoms more than others. However, if at any time you feel any of these symptoms go beyond a detox reaction, please seek advice from your healthcare provider.

---

### May I Do a Warm Water or Coffee Enema? May I Do a Colonic?

We suggest that any enema or colonic be done after the detox bundle is completed (day 8 or beyond) and the body has had a chance to eliminate on its own. Keep in mind that an enema and colonic only deal with the large intestines and the elimination has to travel through the small intestines as well. Additionally, a coffee enema will stain the release.

---

### I Have Inflammation and Desire to Do the FORGIVE Detox First. How Do I Do a Reverse Rainbow?

You will start by doing the FORGIVE detox.

**Day 1** - FORGIVE - follow the instructions for day 6 in the RAINBOW PROTOCOL

**Day 2** - follow the instructions for days 2-5 in the RAINBOW PROTOCOL. However, you'll need packet 10 taken in the morning. See the manuals for more details for the morning after the flush drink

**Day 3** - Start the ONE kit. Follow day 1 in the RAINBOW PROTOCOL

**Days 4-6** - follow the instructions for days 2-5 in the RAINBOW manual

**Day 7** - follow day 7 - but omit the packet 10 instructions since that is for the liver flush that you've already done

---

### Are There Any Conditions Where I Should NOT Do the Rainbow Detox?

**Yes. Renal Issues or Failure**

You should NOT do the ONE or the FORGIVE detoxes included in the RAINBOW PROTOCOL due to the high volume of water. However, you can still cleanse and work on your intestinal and liver health using ZenCleanz liquid enzymes, such as Hygieia, Ambrosia, Mycelia, and Aztec, and sachets such as the Gut Essentials: Quantum Particles, Fiber Crystals, and Black Vacuum. If you have any questions, check with a medical professional.

---

### May I Do the Rainbow Protocol If I Am Pregnant or Nursing?

#### PREGNANT

The ONE, FORGIVE, Mycelia, Chi, and NattoBlast are not advisable for pregnant, or planning to be pregnant, women. However, the ORIGIN kit, all other liquid enzymes, and sachets are good for the mother and baby. Remember that ZenCleanz products are foods with 100% bioavailable nutrients that help cellular nutrition.

**📝 NOTE:** If taking ZenCleanz liquid enzymes for the first time, starting after the third month of pregnancy is recommended. If you have been drinking enzymes before the pregnancy, you may continue to consume them throughout the pregnancy.

#### NURSING

ZenCleanz liquids, powders, and tablets are good to take while nursing; although the Spark would not be advisable.

The INSPIRE Kit is not recommended during nursing due to the potent herbs. The FLOW has the Spark which is not advisable. For the ONE, FORGIVE, and RAINBOW kits, they can be used at the discretion of the parents.

**Alternative option:** Breast pumping prior to the detox to save milk to feed while on the detox can be done, while pumping and dumping during the detox.

---

## Other Things to Consider

### Daily Enzyme Benefits

Taking ZenCleanz enzymes daily helps cleanse and nourish the body's cells on a systemic level, complementing more targeted detox kits. Incorporating these energetic enzymes into a healthful lifestyle significantly supports the ongoing benefits of detoxification and prepares the body for future cleansing efforts.

All liquid enzymes provide the advantages of long-term fermented, completely pre-digested enzymes, ensuring 100% bioavailable nutrients that continuously break down layers of congestion in the body. Each liquid enzyme has a unique profile, so we encourage everyone to explore the properties of each one, select the enzyme(s) that resonate with them, and try a variety for optimal results.

**For intestinal health**, customers often choose Ambrosia, Mycelia, Hygieia, Aztec, Gut Essentials, and Jîng tablets.

**For the liver:** Hygieia, Aztec, Gut Essentials, and Jîng tablets.

### Sample Schedule for System Maintenance

**General Dosing (applies to any liquid enzymes):**

- 25-30 ml / 5-6 tsp, 1-3x daily
- Take in 250 ml / 8.5 oz warm water
- Take 30 minutes before or an hour after food

**Scheduling Enzymes:**

- We suggest spreading enzyme intake throughout the day
- Taking one enzyme at a time
- Waiting an hour or more to take another enzyme dose

**Dosage Guidelines:**

- **1-2 doses daily:** Provides supplemental support for the body
- **3+ doses daily:** Boosts the repair in the body to therapeutic levels
- **90 mL / 18 tsp and above:** Can allow one to fast on and feel full
- **⚠️ Do not exceed 200 mL / 40 tsp:** May lead to overstimulation
