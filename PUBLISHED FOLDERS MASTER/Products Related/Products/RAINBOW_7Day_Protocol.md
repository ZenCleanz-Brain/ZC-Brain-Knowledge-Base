## Philosophy

Just like light refracted through a prism reveals the full spectrum of color, RAINBOW reveals the full spectrum of your health potential—clearing, nourishing, and revitalizing every layer of your digestive, emotional, and energetic self.

This is not a diet. Not a cleanse. Not a challenge. It is a recalibration of your core system—a reset that clears what blocks you, so your true colors can return.

**RAINBOW is a 7-day synergistic journey that combines the most powerful ZenCleanz tools:**

- The deep intestinal sweep of **ONE**
- The liver and bile flow restoration of **FORGIVE**
- The microbiome rebalance of the **Gut Essentials**
- The liquid enzymatic life-force of **HYGIEIA**

Together, they activate every organ of digestion and detox, every metabolic channel of elimination, and every aspect of your inner ecology.

## Gentle Guidance for the 7-Day Rainbow Protocol

### Notes for the ONE Detox (Day 1)

- Try your best to go through the whole protocol, but if you feel nauseous or overly full, slow down—space the sachets
- Try to go through at least 5–6 sachets on Day 1 and conclude with the Fiber Crystals sachet in the evening
- Be sure to complete the remaining sachets the next morning; adjust the times of the other enzymes accordingly—take them at least 30-60 minutes away from each other
- Continue gentle abdominal massages for a few more days and go out for short walks throughout the day. They are key to awakening and releasing

### Notes for the FORGIVE Detox (Day 6)

- You may apply gentle abdominal massage, stretching, and rest—whatever brings your body into its presence
- Propping your head/shoulders so they are above your feet may be helpful to prevent reflux when lying down on your right side after ingesting the flush formula

### General 7-Day Rainbow Notes

- If you're finding that adding the HYGIEIA to the enzyme packet is too sweet or too much, take it with 250ml of lukewarm water at the ½ hour instead
- Be patient. Evacuations come when the body is ready. Transit time is unique to each person
- You will have 1 60ml bottle of Ambrosia and 1 60ml bottle of Hygieia liquid enzymes remaining. You can take them the following days in 20-30ml doses (1-3 doses daily) with 250ml (8.5 oz) of lukewarm water. Take 30 minutes before or 60 minutes after food

## When and What May I Eat/Drink to Break the Fast? (7-Day Rainbow)

You may begin to eat the morning of **Day 8** (after you have completed the detox) or **Day 7 around noon**.

### Good Options for Breaking the Fast:

- Broth (chicken or veggie)
- Fresh green juice
- Fruit
- Steamed veggies

### Foods to Avoid:

- Raw food
- High sugar content fruit juices or smoothies, especially if you have internal dampness

Go slowly with small portions; no fat the first day if possible. Over the course of the week following the detox, we suggest eating liver-friendly foods as well as eating fresh and light meals.

---

## May I Do an Enema or Colonic? (7-Day Rainbow)

We suggest that any enema or colonic be done after the detox bundle is completed (**Day 8 or beyond**) and the body has had a chance to eliminate on its own. Keep in mind that an enema and colonic only deal with the large intestines, and the elimination has to travel through the small intestines as well. Additionally, a coffee enema will stain the release.

---

## Reverse Rainbow Option (7-Day)

If you have inflammation and desire to do the FORGIVE detox first:

| Day | Instructions |
|-----|--------------|
| Day 1 | FORGIVE - follow the instructions for Day 6 in this protocol |
| Day 2 | Follow Days 2-5 instructions. Take packet #10 in the morning (see manuals for morning-after-flush details) |
| Day 3 | Start the ONE kit - follow Day 1 instructions |
| Days 4-6 | Follow Days 2-5 instructions |
| Day 7 | Follow Day 7 instructions but omit the packet #10 (already done after flush) |

---

## Preparation Tips for 7-Day Rainbow Protocol

### Before Starting:

- Stop smoking and do not drink alcohol or caffeine for the duration of the detox
- Eating lightly for a day or two beforehand can be beneficial—choose easily digestible foods such as soups, fruits, and steamed vegetables
- Meat tends to take longer to pass through the digestive system
- Read through the entire checklist and FAQs before attempting the protocol
- Make sure all contents are in the kit
- Lay out all packets and liquid enzymes in order of the schedule. **Take them in order.**
- Keep a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing

### During and After:

- We **strongly recommend** keeping to a liquid diet for the days after the ONE intestinal cleanse so your body may continue to release plaque
- If you begin eating, the body goes into "digestion mode." Only in a fasted state will your body easily release plaque
- If you feel hungry, we suggest more ZenCleanz liquid enzymes, thin broths, miso, raw fresh green juices (no fruit or fiber), and weak herbal tea
- Avoid fiber, fat, and sugars including natural sugar ingredients such as carrots, beets, honey, etc.
- You may drink more warm water throughout the day
- On **Day 6**, we recommend only sips within 2 hours of the flush drink
- Cool or cold water can shock the body; warm water helps disperse the enzymes
- Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes

---

## Conditions Where You Should NOT Do the 7-Day Rainbow

### Renal Issues or Failure

You should NOT do the ONE or FORGIVE detoxes due to the high volume of water. However, you can still cleanse using ZenCleanz liquid enzymes (Hygieia, Ambrosia, Mycelia, Aztec) and sachets (Gut Essentials). Consult a medical professional if you have questions.

---

## If There Is Internal Inflammation

**Consider this protocol BEFORE doing the 7-Day Rainbow:**

Take Mycelia liquid enzymes (or Lightseed if you have sugar issues) and the Gut Essentials for 3-4 weeks or longer to reduce internal inflammation. Start slowly by introducing one product at a time and monitor your body's response.

**Liquid Enzymes Dosing:**
- Two doses daily, separately
- 25ml/5 tsp with 250ml/8.5 oz of warm water
- Start with one dose and increase as the body adjusts

**Gut Essentials for Inflammation:**
- Quantum Particles: Away from food, dissolved in mouth or with 250ml warm water daily
- Black Vacuum: With 500ml warm water away from food, once or twice daily
- Fiber Crystals: With 250ml warm water in the evening before bedtime
