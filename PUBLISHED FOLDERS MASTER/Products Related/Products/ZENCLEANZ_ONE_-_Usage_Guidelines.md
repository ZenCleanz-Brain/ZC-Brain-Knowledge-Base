## Our Connection to Nature

*"Inseparable from the whole, we are born from the womb of the earth, same flesh, we are one."*

This isn't just a poetic truth — it's a living reality.

We are not separate from Nature. We are Nature, made of the same waters that move through rivers, the same minerals that form mountains, the same breath that stirs the trees. The Earth is not a backdrop to our lives; it is the body we live in. It feeds us, holds us, and reminds us of who we are when we forget.

In the rush of modern life, it's easy to feel disconnected — cut off from the deeper rhythms, the stillness, the simplicity. But when we cleanse the body, when we quiet the noise, something ancient awakens. A remembering.

We are part of something vast and intelligent. Every cell in us echoes the balance of ecosystems. Every inhale draws in what the forest breathes out. When we pollute, deplete, or ignore the Earth, we do the same to ourselves and vice versa. But when we nurture her — through conscious living, healing foods, and daily choices that honor life — we also restore our own vitality.

This is why we begin with cleansing. Because healing is not just about fixing symptoms — it's about returning to wholeness. Detoxifying the body is a sacred act of reconnection. As we clear the inner terrain, we remember we belong. We are part of this web. And the Earth is not just beneath our feet — She is within our bones.

To walk this path is to live as one — rooted, alive, and aligned with the greater pulse of life.

## Guided Protocol for Inner Clarity with the ZenCleanz ONE

This is your journey inward — a sacred reset from the core of your being. Today is the time to soften, release, and return to harmony with your digestive system.

### Getting Started

Begin each intake by pouring lukewarm water first then adding either a sachet or liquid enzymes in a tightly sealed jar. Shake it like you're waking up the enzymes — 5–6 firm shakes.

### Morning Flow

- [ ] **09:00 AM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #1
- [ ] **09:30 AM** | 20ml (4 tsp) AMBROSIA in 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water
- [ ] **10:00 AM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #2
- [ ] **10:30 AM** | 20ml (4 tsp) AMBROSIA in 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water
- [ ] **11:00 AM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #3
- [ ] **11:30 AM** | 20ml (4 tsp) AMBROSIA in 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water

**Pause. Breathe. Lie down.** Gently massage your abdomen, often, focusing on tender spots. Connect with what is being awakened.

### Afternoon Flow

- [ ] **14:00 PM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #4
- [ ] **14:30 PM** | 20ml (4 tsp) AMBROSIA in 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water
- [ ] **15:00 PM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #5
- [ ] **15:30 PM** | 20ml (4 tsp) AMBROSIA in 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water

**Rest. Walk.** Massage your abdomen often, focusing on the tender spots. Let the enzymes circulate. Let your body speak.

### Evening Flow

- [ ] **18:00 PM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #6
- [ ] **18:30 PM** | 20ml (4 tsp) AMBROSIA in 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water
- [ ] **19:00 PM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #7
- [ ] **19:30 PM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water — a simple rinse
- [ ] **20:00 PM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #8
- [ ] **21:00 PM** | Fiber Crystals – Bowel Reset Powder + 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water

Create a soft, nurturing environment. This is the nurturing end to your detox day. Sleep deeply. Let the night do its work.

### Next Morning Integration

- [ ] **08:00 AM** | 30ml (6 tsp) AMBROSIA in 250 ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water — accompany with abdominal massage
- [ ] **10:00 AM** | Last 30ml dose of AMBROSIA in 250 ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water— massage and listen to your intestines.

## Gentle Guidance & Intuitive Listening

- Try your best to go through the whole protocol but if you feel nauseous or overly full, slow down — space the sachets. Try to go through at least 5–6 sachets on Day 1 and conclude with the Fiber Crystals sachet in the evening. Be sure to complete the remaining sachets the next morning before the last 2 doses of AMBROSIA.

- Continue gentle abdominal massages and go out for short walks throughout the day. They are key to awakening and releasing.

- **Day 2 (or longer, if you choose):** Stay on clear liquids only. ZenCleanz enzymes are best (liquid + 3 Gut Essentials). You may also have warm broths, miso, and herbal teas — this keeps your system in autophagy and continuous cleansing.

- Be patient. Evacuations come when the body is ready. Transit time is unique to each person.

**You are not just cleansing your intestines — you are clearing your path forward.**

Stay present. Keep smiling. Trust the wisdom of your body.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Pre-Detox Considerations for Internal Inflammation

**If there is internal inflammation, please consider the following protocol before doing a ONE, FORGIVE, RAINBOW, or RAINBOW PLUS protocol.**

Consider taking the Mycelia liquid enzymes (or Lightseed if you have sugar issues), and the Gut Essentials (GE) - Black Vacuum, Quantum Particles, and Fiber Crystals to reduce internal inflammation. These can be taken for 3 to 4 weeks or longer. Start slowly by introducing one product at a time and monitor how your body responds for several days. Begin adding the other products in the same manner. Adjust the dosages or make changes as needed. Once symptoms shift and the person is comfortable going forward, the ONE or FORGIVE can be used. Sometimes, the FORGIVE is done before the ONE to improve the overall condition further.

#### Liquid Enzymes

The dosing for the Mycelia/Lightseed is two doses, separately, daily, at 25 mL/5 tsp with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water. Start with one dose and increase as the body adjusts.

#### The Gut Essentials

- The Quantum Particles can be taken away from food with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water daily.
- The Black Vacuum should be taken with 500 mL/17 oz of warm water away from food once or twice daily.
- The Fiber Crystals should be taken with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water in the evening before bedtime.
- Additionally, if one has issues with intestinal inflammation, it can be helpful to begin with a liver detox first.

### Additional Tips for Doing a ONE Kit

#### Preparation

- Stop smoking and do not drink alcohol or caffeine for the duration of the detox.

- The enzyme detoxes are designed not to require much preparation to do them. Eating lightly for a day or two beforehand can be beneficial. Choose easily digestible foods such as soups, fruits, and steamed vegetables. Meat tends to take longer to pass through the digestive system. You will be detoxing for a day or more, so additionally, preparing your mind for being with the process is wise.

- Read through the entire checklist and frequently asked questions (FAQs) for the ONE kit detox before attempting and follow the instructions carefully.

- Make sure that all the contents are in the kit. In the extremely rare instance that something is missing, contact customer care or the support team on Facebook or Telegram for more guidance on how to proceed.

- The packets are numbered. Lay out all packets and liquid enzymes in order of the schedule and numbering of packets. **PLEASE TAKE THEM IN ORDER.**

- The time frame suggested above is a guide. You may adjust the detox's starting time frame to meet your schedule.

- Keep a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing ~ the more details the better.

#### During and After

- We **STRONGLY** recommend keeping to a liquid diet for the days after the ONE intestinal cleanse so your body may continue to release plaque. It is important to know that if you begin eating, the body goes into "digestion mode." Only in a fasted state will your body easily release plaque. If you feel hungry, we suggest more ZenCleanz liquid enzymes, thin broths (chicken or veggie), Miso, raw fresh GREEN juices (no fruit or fiber), and weak herbal tea. Avoid fiber, fat, and sugars, including natural sugar ingredients such as carrots, beets, honey, etc.

- You may drink more warm water or liquid enzymes throughout the day of the detox. Cool or cold water can shock the body, requiring energy to warm it. The warm water helps disperse the enzymes throughout an empty stomach to absorb them more quickly.

- Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes, and check with your doctor if necessary.

- When using ZenCleanz enzymes with warm water, they provide whole foods that are abundant in electrolytes and deliver the necessary "charge" for the body's cells, making additional substances unnecessary during a detox.

- You'll find you're full from using the enzymes provided in the kit. If by chance you "feel" hungry, we encourage exploring how much of the hunger is emotional and a state of feeling empty. The feeling of emptiness contains much wisdom if we allow ourselves to explore it.

- Continue gentle abdominal massages for a few more days and go out for short walks throughout the day. They are key to awakening and releasing.

- During the days after the detox, you may work or go to the gym, however, staying or working from home is better; relaxing and focusing on yourself are important parts of the detoxing process.

- There is a required expiration date listed on each kit. If unopened, the kits will be usable long after the expiration date.

#### Added User Tips for the ONE Kit

- Try to have as stress-free a day as you possibly can.
- Consider Witch Hazel, castor or coconut oil, and a bidet (portable works, too) for the anal "soreness."
- Set a timer to help keep the schedule.
- Put the water in a jar, add the powder, put on the lid, shake very firmly and quickly a few times, and drink it all immediately before it sets up. Keep drinking until it's gone. If you wait, some packets get thicker as time passes, making it more difficult to drink.
- Take a packet of Fiber Crystals (if you have additional sachets) the next morning and night as well.
- It's important to be gentle with yourself during this journey towards better health. There will be moments that feel challenging or less enjoyable, and that's completely okay. Remember to take a step back and remind yourself of the bigger picture, both before and during your drink. You're working towards a healthier you, and every step, even the tough ones, is part of that process.

### Will the ONE intestinal detox get out all of my plaque?

The body will eliminate what it can in any round of detoxing, but how many times the intestines need to be detoxed to get everything out varies. It may take many intestinal detoxes to clear enough accumulation to repair nutrient absorption. On average, it can take four to six intestinal detoxes for those without any long-standing digestive or health issues; for others, it can be many more.

---

### What comes out with this kit? How can I tell the difference between the fiber product and mucoid plaque?

The ZenCleanz fiber product resembles what you might imagine when fiber is mixed with water and left to sit. In contrast, mucoid plaque has a thick, rubbery texture similar to that of actual plaque. While the fiber is not easily picked up, the mucoid plaque can be easily lifted with a fork or chopsticks and remains intact. For examples, please check out the website at www.zencleanz.com

### How to do an abdominal massage. How to help your body release. Where your abdomen might hurt and why.

Using the photo below of the large and small intestines, the whole middle area of the abdomen is the small intestine. Please notice the 4 "junctions" or curves of the large intestine.

Begin by lying on your back with your knees bent, which relaxes the abdominal muscles. Gently massage the area of the small intestine, spending time on the sore, sensitive, or hard spots; massage the center of your abdomen in circles with your fist, working outward from your center. Then, massage the large intestine at the junctions, starting at #4 closest to the anus (lower left side of the body) and massaging each junction in reverse order moving towards the lower right side, #1. This will ensure that the detox pathway is opened from the end to the beginning, preventing blockages. Working on the abdomen in this reversed sequence and going back and forth in direction can aid the peristalsis and elimination process.

During an intestinal cleanse, while working on different spots within the intestines, one may come across places where peristalsis may have been slowed down due to certain factors such as consumption of mucus-forming foods, inflammation, emotional stress, adhesions, or poor posture. Additionally, there are layers of fascia throughout the abdomen and these layers of fascia can have adhesions or stuck spots.

The One intestinal detox can help illuminate tightness and inflammation and reduce congestion in areas that have been problematic for a long time. This is why abdominal work is so crucial, as it can help you identify where the congestion is and provide a roadmap for balancing your body.

**Please note:** The Ileocecal Valve is the juncture between the small and large intestines, #1. The ileocecal valve opens to allow stool from the small to large intestine. Bacterial or prokaryote overgrowth, intestinal inflammation, and/or a sympathetic/stressed nervous system can contribute to the valve not opening autonomously. This area can ache as stool or gas builds on the other side of the valve. When you're making progress with your cleansing, you may find the following stretching technique to be helpful:

**Video instruction on Ileocecal Valve release technique:**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATmSVdeSo_U

We suggest focusing on abdominal massage as often as possible on the day of the intestinal detox and the days after for the best results.

---

### Why does it take so long to see my release?

You may experience different abdominal sensations throughout the process, which is common. The time it takes to see results depends on your intestinal transit time. Typically, you'll notice the fiber product on the first day, while plaque, if your body released any, may be released within two to three days after, but it can take longer.

---

### What if I don't see any plaque, does it mean I don't have any?

In cases of ongoing inflammation, internal dampness, and emotional holding multiple cleanses may be necessary to begin to eliminate and see the plaque. Over many years, plaque accumulation has built up within the intestinal tract that is 5m/16 ft long. However, it is important to note the enzymes work throughout the body, cleansing and nourishing all cells, so there's no need for concern even if very little or no plaque is eliminated.

---

### When will I see my releases come out?

Those with faster digestion may see results sooner than those with slower systems. Focusing on abdominal massage, deep breathing, and trusting the process can help especially the first time.

---

### Is there anything I can do to help "move things along?"

If you'd like, you can help things along by doing a warm water or coffee enema. Remember, if you do a coffee enema and want to examine your release, it will be stained. Intestinal massages are also helpful. If you're uncomfortable, try a castor oil pack; adding some heat to that can be quite soothing. Additionally, please consider an Ileocecal valve release; please search online for this procedure.

---

### I was told I have internal dampness, what does that mean? What can I do?

According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), internal dampness is an imbalance in the body's moisture levels. It is often attributed to factors such as a poor diet, weak digestion, and a sedentary lifestyle. Enzyme intake, especially through the ONE intestinal detox and FORGIVE liver detox kits, purges a big load of the dampness located in the digestive tract, but dampness is invasive and absolutely needs to be addressed by integrating a few lifestyle elements: Diet, hydration, avoiding dampening foods, exercise, sleep and rest, stress management, things such as acupuncture, massage, saunas, cupping, gua sha, and herbal medicine. It is important to note that TCM is a holistic approach that evaluates the root cause of symptoms and treats the individual as a whole. A good TCM practitioner, more than just applying treatments, will help you by suggesting lifestyle adjustments to address your unique condition and constitution. Search the internet for other factors, such as environmental impact.

---

### May I do a warm water or coffee enema? May I do a colonic?

We suggest that any enema or colonic be done after the detox kit is completed and the body has had a chance to eliminate on its own. Keep in mind that an enema and colonic only deal with the large intestines and the elimination must travel through the small intestines as well.

---

### When and what may I eat/drink to break the fast?

You may begin to eat after a day or so of fasting. Try to discern how your body is feeling and check if there are any hard/tender spots in your abdomen. If there are, you may want to fast a bit longer and stay on abdominal massages. When you decide to break the fast, start with easily digestible food: broth (chicken or veggie), and steamed veggies are good options. Avoid raw food, high sugar content fruit juices, smoothies, or fruit, especially if it is determined you have internal dampness ~ please do a web search for more information. Go slowly with small portions; no fat the first day if possible. Over the course of the week following the detox, we suggest eating liver-friendly foods as well as eating fresh and smaller portioned meals. Research online for liver friendly foods and drinks/recipes and use this opportunity to make healthful changes to your diet.

---

### I am getting a headache; I have heartburn; I have gas and bloating. I feel lightheaded; I am becoming nauseous. What if I vomit?

Detox headaches and heartburn are symptoms of toxins moving through the body/liver and will pass. Detox nausea can be from fear and/or indicating toxins moving through the liver. ALL indigestion symptoms are common when detoxing, including gas, bloating, burping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Your body works hard to break up the accumulation, and symptoms will soon slow down. Helpful tools include a castor oil pack, heating pad, abdominal massage, drinking more warm water, working with your breath to calm the body, light movements such as going for a walk, and a nap if you can take one.

Remember, detox reactions are common, even if you have done detoxing before. Detoxing with enzymes is an amazing experience for your body, and some people experience deeper symptoms more than others. However, if at any time you feel any of these symptoms go beyond a detox reaction, please seek advice from your healthcare provider.

---

### May I take the ONE kit while menstruating?

A woman's monthly cycle serves as a natural form of detoxification, so it is advisable to consider waiting until at least the third day of the cycle, or longer, depending on individual responses to the cycle, before starting any detox programs. Some women experience difficult periods and may choose to wait until their cycle has completely ended. Ultimately, this decision is a personal preference.

---

### May I do a ONE kit and follow it with a FORGIVE kit the next day?

We suggest a minimum of one-day between the intestinal and liver kits to begin releasing mucoid plaque.

**Day 1:** ONE kit  
**Day 2:** release day  
**Day 3:** FORGIVE kit  
**Day 4:** release day

---

### Does the ONE kill parasites?

The ONE detoxifier doesn't kill parasites. Parasites are only able to thrive in a stagnant environment. In addition to clearing mucoid plaque, doing the FORGIVE liver detox after the ONE intestinal detoxifier helps to begin to alkalize the intestines through improved bile flow. Over time, continual detoxing and a supportive healthful lifestyle will help restore the digestive system's integrity and alkalinity, making the body an unwelcome environment for parasites.

---

### Are there any conditions where I should not do the ONE kit?

**Yes. Renal Issues or Failure**

You should NOT do the ONE intestinal detox due to the high volume of water. However, you can still cleanse and work on your intestinal and liver health using ZenCleanz liquid enzymes, such as Hygieia, Ambrosia, Mycelia, and Aztec, and sachets such as the Gut Essentials: Quantum Particles, Fiber Crystals, and Black Vacuum. If you have any questions, check with a medical professional.

---

### May I do the ONE kit if I am pregnant or nursing?

#### PREGNANCY: No

The ONE, FORGIVE, FLOW, INSPIRE, Mycelia, Chi, Spark, and NattoBlast are not advisable for pregnant, or planning to be pregnant. However, the ORIGIN kit, all other liquid enzymes, and sachets are good for the mother and baby. Remember that ZenCleanz products are foods with 100% bioavailable nutrients that help cellular nutrition.

**NOTE:** If taking ZenCleanz liquid enzymes for the first time, starting after the third month of pregnancy is recommended. If you have been drinking enzymes before the pregnancy, you may continue to consume them throughout the pregnancy.

#### NURSING

ZenCleanz liquids, powders, and tablets are good to take while nursing; although the Spark would not be advisable.

The INSPIRE Kit is not recommended during nursing due to the potent herbs. The FLOW has the Spark which is not advisable. For the ONE, FORGIVE, and RAINBOW kits, they can be used at the discretion of the parents; alternative option: breast pumping prior to the detox to save milk to feed while on the detox can be done, while pumping and dumping during the detox.

---

## Other Things to Consider

- Taking ZenCleanz enzymes daily helps cleanse and nourish the body's cells on a systemic level, complementing more targeted detox kits. Incorporating these energetic enzymes into a healthful lifestyle significantly supports the ongoing benefits of detoxification and prepares the body for future cleansing efforts.

- All liquid enzymes provide the advantages of long-term fermented, completely pre-digested enzymes, ensuring 100% bioavailable nutrients that continuously break down layers of congestion in the body. Each liquid enzyme has a unique profile, so we encourage everyone to explore the properties of each one, select the enzyme(s) that resonate with them, and try a variety for optimal results. For intestinal health, customers often choose Ambrosia, Mycelia, Hygieia, Aztec, Gut Essentials, and Jîng tablets.

### Sample Schedule for System Maintenance

**This applies to any liquid enzymes:** 25-30 ml/5-6 tsp, 1-3x daily. Take in 250 ml /8.5 oz warm water. Take 30 minutes before or an hour after food.

**Scheduling enzymes:** We suggest spreading enzyme intake throughout the day, taking one enzyme at a time, and waiting an hour or more to take another enzyme dose.

- One 25 mL/5 tsp dose of liquid enzymes once or twice daily will provide supplemental support for the body.
- Taking 3 or more doses of liquid enzymes daily boosts the repair in the body to therapeutic levels.
- Daily doses of 90 mL /18 tsp and above can allow one to fast on and feel full. We do not recommend exceeding 200 mL/40 tsp, as it may lead to overstimulation.

## A Little Bit About ZenCleanz Products

- Since we ferment 152+ plants and work with small and big farmers all over the world, it is impossible to ask them all to get the Organic Certification.

Additionally, the factory is ISO 22000 and HACCP certified.

- All ZenCleanz products are fermented, for three years, except the FORGIVE flush drink, INSPIRE tea, and ORIGIN Jîng.
