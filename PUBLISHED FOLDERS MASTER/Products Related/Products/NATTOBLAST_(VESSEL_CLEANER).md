- Reduces arterial stiffness, improving blood circulation and lowering cardiovascular risks
- Supports vascular elasticity, preventing premature aging of blood vessels

**Circulatory System Importance:**
Plum powder aids in removing toxins that can cause inflammation in arteries and supports heart health by preventing oxidative damage.

### 2. Erythritol

**Detoxing Properties:**
- Non-glycemic sweetener that doesn't contribute to sugar spikes, reducing the risk of insulin-related vascular damage
- Passes through the body without being metabolized, avoiding stress on the liver and kidneys

**Nourishing Properties:**
- Contains antioxidant properties that help reduce oxidative stress in blood vessels
- Unlike sugar, it doesn't feed harmful bacteria in the gut that can contribute to inflammation

**Healing Properties:**
- Helps reduce the formation of harmful free radicals that can damage blood vessels
- Protects capillary health, keeping microcirculation intact

**Circulatory System Importance:**
Erythritol helps reduce sugar-related vascular stress, which is crucial in preventing arterial inflammation and blood vessel damage.

### 3. Natto Enzyme Powder (Nattokinase)

**Detoxing Properties:**
- Breaks down fibrin, a protein that can cause blood clots and restrict circulation
- Helps dissolve excess cholesterol and arterial plaque, clearing blocked vessels
