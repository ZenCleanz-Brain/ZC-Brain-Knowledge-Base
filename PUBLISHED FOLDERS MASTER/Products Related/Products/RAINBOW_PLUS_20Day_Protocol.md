The Rainbow Plus Protocol includes **2 ONE kits**, **3 FORGIVE kits**, 1 Gut Essentials Kit (30 pack), 1 HYGIEIA (750ml), 1 AMBROSIA (750ml), and 1 LIGHTSEED (750ml).

### How long does the 20-Day Rainbow Plus Protocol take?

The Rainbow Plus Protocol is a **20-day** transformational enzymatic journey with multiple intestinal cleanses and three liver flushes for deeper detoxification.

### What is the difference between Rainbow Plus (20-Day) and Rainbow (7-Day)?

Rainbow is a **7-day** protocol with **one** intestinal cleanse and **one** liver flush. Rainbow Plus is a **20-day** intensive with **two** intestinal cleanses, **three** liver flushes, and additional liquid enzymes (LIGHTSEED and full-size AMBROSIA) for deeper transformation.

### Why choose the 20-Day Rainbow Plus over the 7-Day Rainbow?

The Rainbow Plus Protocol is designed for those ready to go deeper with higher enzyme dosages, multiple flushes, and sustained therapeutic nourishment. It provides more thorough cleansing of both the digestive tract and biliary system.

### What should I avoid during the 20-Day Rainbow Plus Protocol?

During the detox, avoid smoking, alcohol, caffeine, fiber, fat, and sugars including natural sugars like carrots, beets, and honey. Stick to a liquid diet between cleanse days.

### Can I do the 20-Day Rainbow Plus Protocol if I'm pregnant or nursing?

**Pregnant:** The ONE and FORGIVE detoxes are not advisable for pregnant women, though other liquid enzymes and sachets are safe.

**Nursing:** The protocol can be used with discretion, or milk can be pumped beforehand and stored while pumping and dumping during the detox.

### What should I do if I experience detox symptoms?

Detox headaches, heartburn, and nausea are common symptoms of toxins moving through the body and will pass. Helpful tools include castor oil packs (NOT on flush days), heating pads, abdominal massage, more warm water, and light movement like walking.

## Philosophy

The **RAINBOW PLUS Protocol** is not just a detox—it's a **20-day catalytic reset** that targets the two most essential systems for detoxification and vitality: the **Digestive Tract** and the **Biliary System** (Liver & Gallbladder).

Designed for those ready to go deeper, this powerful protocol amplifies the original RAINBOW experience with higher enzyme dosages, multiple flushes, and sustained therapeutic nourishment.

### This Intensive 20-Day Enzyme Journey Helps To:

- Begin to eliminate years of accumulated waste, mucoid plaque, and bile sludge
- Reignite and regenerate digestive function and enzyme potential
- Revitalize your liver metabolism and begin restoring hormonal harmony
- Develop a cleaner inner terrain that promotes a foundation for a full-body detox

The RAINBOW PLUS Protocol is your gateway to a true transformational experience. It doesn't just clear debris—it awakens the body's own intelligence and builds momentum toward deep, lasting healing. Many who walk this path report breakthroughs not only in physical health, but also in mental clarity, emotional release, and spiritual connection.

*Commit to the deep. Step into your power. Begin your transformation.*

## Gentle Guidance for the 20-Day Rainbow Plus Protocol

### Notes for the ONE Detox Days (Day 1 and Day 18)

- Try your best to go through the whole protocol, but if you feel nauseous or overly full, slow down—space the sachets
- Try to go through at least 5–6 sachets on each ONE day and conclude with the Fiber Crystals sachet in the evening
- Be sure to complete the remaining sachets the next morning; adjust the times of the other enzymes accordingly—take them at least 30-60 minutes away from each other
- Continue gentle abdominal massages for a few more days and go out for short walks throughout the day

### Notes for the FORGIVE Detox Days (Day 6, Day 11, and Day 16)

- You may apply gentle abdominal massage, stretching, and rest—whatever brings your body into its presence
- Propping your head/shoulders so they are above your feet may be helpful to prevent reflux when lying down on your right side after ingesting the flush formula

### General 20-Day Rainbow Plus Notes

- If you're finding that adding any of the liquid enzymes to the enzyme packet is too sweet or too much, take it with 250ml of lukewarm water at the ½ hour instead
- Be patient. Evacuations come when the body is ready. Transit time is unique to each person
- You will have 2 - 60ml bottles of Ambrosia and 3 - 60ml bottles of Hygieia liquid enzymes remaining. You can take them the following days in 20-30ml doses (1-3 doses daily) with 250ml (8.5 oz) of lukewarm water. Take 30 minutes before or 60 minutes after food

## When and What May I Eat/Drink to Break the Fast? (20-Day Rainbow Plus)

You may begin to eat the morning of **Day 21**.

### Good Options for Breaking the Fast:

- Broth (chicken or veggie)
- Fresh green juice
- Fruit
- Steamed veggies

### Foods to Avoid:

- Raw food
- High sugar content fruit juices or smoothies, especially if you have internal dampness

Go slowly with small portions; no fat the first day if possible. Over the course of the week following the detox, we suggest eating liver-friendly foods as well as eating fresh and light meals.

---

## May I Do an Enema or Colonic? (20-Day Rainbow Plus)

We suggest that any enema or colonic be done after the first set of detox kits are completed—the first ONE and FORGIVE (**Day 8 or beyond**)—and the body has had a chance to eliminate on its own. Keep in mind that an enema and colonic only deal with the large intestines, and the elimination has to travel through the small intestines as well. Additionally, a coffee enema will stain the release.

Try to refrain from doing enemas too frequently during this 20-day protocol. As the protocol progresses, you should feel the need for one to begin to reduce.

---

## Preparation Tips for 20-Day Rainbow Plus Protocol

### Before Starting:

- Stop smoking and do not drink alcohol or caffeine for the duration of the detox
- Eating lightly for a day or two beforehand can be beneficial—choose easily digestible foods such as soups, fruits, and steamed vegetables
- Meat tends to take longer to pass through the digestive system
- Read through the entire checklist and FAQs before attempting the protocol
- Make sure all contents are in the kit
- Lay out all packets and liquid enzymes in order of the schedule. **Take them in order.**
- Keep a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing

### During and After:

- We **strongly recommend** keeping to a liquid diet for the days between cleanse days so your body may continue to release plaque
- If you begin eating, the body goes into "digestion mode." Only in a fasted state will your body easily release plaque
- If you feel hungry, we suggest more ZenCleanz liquid enzymes, thin broths, miso, raw fresh green juices (no fruit or fiber), and weak herbal tea
- Avoid fiber, fat, and sugars including natural sugar ingredients such as carrots, beets, honey, etc.
- You may drink more warm water throughout the day
- On **flush days (Day 6, 11, 16)**, we recommend only sips within 2 hours of the flush drink
- Cool or cold water can shock the body; warm water helps disperse the enzymes
- Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes

## Conditions Where You Should NOT Do the 20-Day Rainbow Plus

### Renal Issues or Failure

You should NOT do the ONE or FORGIVE detoxes due to the high volume of water. However, you can still cleanse using ZenCleanz liquid enzymes (Hygieia, Ambrosia, Mycelia, Aztec) and sachets (Gut Essentials). Consult a medical professional if you have questions.

---

## If There Is Internal Inflammation

**Consider this protocol BEFORE doing the 20-Day Rainbow Plus:**

Take Mycelia liquid enzymes (or Lightseed if you have sugar issues) and the Gut Essentials for 3-4 weeks or longer to reduce internal inflammation. Start slowly by introducing one product at a time and monitor your body's response.

**Liquid Enzymes Dosing:**
- Two doses daily, separately
- 25ml/5 tsp with 250ml/8.5 oz of warm water
- Start with one dose and increase as the body adjusts

**Gut Essentials for Inflammation:**
- Quantum Particles: Away from food, dissolved in mouth or with 250ml warm water daily
- Black Vacuum: With 500ml warm water away from food, once or twice daily
- Fiber Crystals: With 250ml warm water in the evening before bedtime
