## Overview

### The Toxicity Entry Points & Filtration System

We slowly get intoxicated following the main entry points: the intestines, the lungs, and the skin. From there, the toxins penetrate the bloodstream and, carried by the blood, go through three primary filters:
- **The liver** - receives the most significant load of toxins
- **The lymphatic system** - absorbs toxic particles that have crossed the first barrier
- **The kidneys** - receives toxins when the lymphatic system is overloaded

Due to their detoxification functions, these organs gradually become saturated with impurities and require support.

### The ZenCleanz Way

The ZenCleanz Way is a 6-month detox & rejuvenation schedule divided into six bundles, each designed for approximately one month. Each is designed to help gradually dig deeper and deeper into the toxicity of various drainage pathways and layers of tissues while constantly taking care of upstream sources of filtration and intoxication.

### The ORIGIN Kidney Cleanse Philosophy

We have created all our cleanse and maintenance kits based on plants with promising compounds to purify the kidneys. From day 1, anyone who has started taking our enzyme blends has begun to cleanse their kidneys.

**Revolutionary Approach:**
Our therapeutic and systemic enzymes penetrated the blood, journeyed throughout the body's system, and initiated kidney purification.

With the ORIGIN cleansing and maintenance kits, we go beyond simple enzyme support. We've put more focus on the **regeneration of the kidneys** to boost vitality so that:
- Performance of circulatory and immune systems is notably improved
- Brain functions increased
- Allergic symptoms reduced
- Antioxidant, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial properties strengthened
- Sexual functions enhanced
- A glow is added to skin and hair
- Most profound support of all upstream drainage pathways maintained

## Traditional Chinese Medicine & Naturopathic Medicine

### Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Perspective

#### The Kidneys in TCM

The kidneys are the root of all yin and yang energies in the body and are considered the foundation of good health.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Considered one of the essential organs
- Responsible for several vital functions
- Associated with the element of **Water**

#### Kidney Functions in TCM

**Jing (Essence) Storage:**
- Kidneys store Jing, similar to "vital essence"
- Considered foundation of one's life force
- Responsible for growth, development, and reproduction

**Water Metabolism & Fluid Balance:**
- Regulate body's fluid balance
- Control water metabolism
- Filter and excrete waste products through urine
- Control urination
- Help maintain proper hydration

**Bone & Marrow Connection:**
- Associated with the bones
- Believed to influence bone development and strength
- Produce marrow, which nourishes bones
- Marrow is dense substance nourishing body
- Nourishes brain and spinal cord
- Support brain function
- Nourish bones and joints

**Reproductive Functions:**
- Associated with both male and female reproductive functions
- Regulate sexual maturation
- Support fertility
- Maintain health of reproductive organs

**Emotional & Willpower Connection:**
- Associated with emotions of willpower and fear
- Balanced kidney energy supports strong willpower
- Supports determination
- Supports ability to overcome fear

#### TCM Recommendations for Kidney Health

To support kidneys and promote overall health and well-being:
- Proper diet
- Regular exercise
- Healthy lifestyle practices

### Naturopathic Medicine Perspective

#### The Kidneys as Main Emunctories

According to naturopathic medicine, the kidneys are considered one of the main emunctories (eliminatory organs) that allow for:
- Elimination of cellular waste
- Removal of blood impurities
- Waste removal

#### Kidney Structure & Function

**Nephrons:**
- Each kidney comprises millions of tiny nephrons (functional kidney units)
- Filter blood to maintain acid-base balance (pH)
- Support homeostasis (self-regulating process)

#### The Problem of Accumulation

Even though kidneys detoxify every day by themselves, they are able to accumulate a lot of waste over time.

Like filters, if they're not functioning correctly:
- Body has to equilibrate and find balance
- Body somehow stores waste somewhere in the body
- In kidney's case: kidney stones, crystal calcium masses, unprocessed minerals
- These can grow to the size of a golf ball
- Found in urinary system

**Long-Term Effects:**
- Over time, toxins and waste products poison the body
- Organs work less efficiently

#### Naturopathic Recommendations

In naturopathy, detoxification methods:
- Eliminate waste
- Stimulate renal functions
- Recommend well-combined diet with leafy vegetables
- Maintain alkalinity in body
- Promote kidney health

## Anatomy & Physiology

### Anatomy of the Kidneys

The kidneys are a pair of vital organs on either side of the spine, below the rib cage. They are responsible for several crucial bodily functions relating to blood filtration and urine production.

#### Physical Structure

**Size & Shape:**
- Each kidney approximately size of a fist
- Bean-shaped structure

**Location & Protection:**
- Located on either side of spine
- Below rib cage
- Layer of protective fat surrounds them
- Located in retroperitoneal space of abdomen

**Internal Layers:**
- **Outer layer** - Renal cortex
- **Inner region** - Renal medulla
- Renal medulla consists of several pyramid-shaped structures called renal pyramids

**Blood Supply & Connection:**
- Kidneys receive blood supply through renal arteries
- Blood drained through renal veins
- Each kidney connected to bladder through tube called ureter
- Ureter carries urine from kidneys to bladder

### Physiology of the Kidneys

The complex anatomy and physiology of the kidneys allow them to perform essential functions in health and homeostasis in the body.

#### Key Functions

**1. Filtration**
- Primary function is to filter waste and excess substances from bloodstream
- Blood enters kidneys through renal arteries
- Within kidneys, tiny functional units called nephrons perform filtration process

**2. Reabsorption**
- As blood is filtered in nephrons, essential substances are selectively reabsorbed into bloodstream
- Essential substances include: water, glucose, ions, certain nutrients
- Helps maintain proper balance of these substances
- Prevents their loss through urine

**3. Secretion**
- Kidneys play role in secretion of waste products, drugs, and toxins into urine
- Additional step in eliminating substances not adequately filtered during initial filtration

**4. Urine Production**
- After filtration, reabsorption, and secretion processes, remaining fluid (urine) is excreted
- Urine collects in renal pelvis (central area within kidney)
- Then moves into ureters for transport to bladder

**5. Regulation of Water & Electrolytes**
- Kidneys help maintain proper fluid balance and electrolyte levels
- Regulate excretion or retention of water, sodium, potassium, calcium, other vital electrolytes
- Ensure optimal concentration in body's fluids

**6. Acid-Base Balance**
- Kidneys play crucial role in maintaining body's acid-base balance
- Regulate levels of hydrogen and bicarbonate ions in blood
- Help prevent acidosis or alkalosis
- Prevents disruption of normal bodily functions

#### Kidney Capacity & Daily Function

Healthy kidneys filter about half a cup of blood per minute, eliminating waste and additional water for urination.

**Daily Kidney Work:**
- Designed to eliminate toxins and waste from body daily
- If they don't, they store excess waste
- Excess waste eventually burdens normal functions of kidneys, liver, other organs

#### Consequences of Dysfunction

Over time, waste build-up leads to:
- Exhaustion
- Stomach pain
- Headaches
- Water retention
- Other problems

**Additional Consequences:**
- Can lead to kidney stones
- Masses of crystals or unprocessed minerals
- Can grow to size of golf ball

**Positive Note:**
Cleansing the kidneys improves your ability to:
- Process certain foods
- Absorb nutrients
- Convert food to energy

## Why Cleanse

### Most Common Symptoms of Clogged Kidneys

A toxic kidney can have very dramatic expressions, like acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute renal failure, which refers to sudden and rapid decline in kidney function due to toxic effects of various substances. In these cases, one needs to seek medical support.

More commonly, multiple symptoms indicate unhealthy kidneys, and they can vary depending on underlying cause.

#### Common Symptoms

1. **Decreased urine output or oliguria** - Producing less urine or having infrequent urination. In some cases, there may be complete lack of urine production.

2. **Swelling or edema** - Accumulation of fluid in body, leading to swelling in legs, feet, ankles, or face due to impaired ability of kidneys to remove excess fluid.

3. **Fatigue and weakness** - Toxins cause overall weakness and fatigue due to decreased kidney function, leading to anemia and inadequate waste removal from bloodstream.

4. **Changes in urination** - Various changes in urination patterns such as cloudy or foamy urine, frequent urination, urgency, or difficulty.

5. **Nausea and vomiting** - Accumulating waste products in body can lead to nausea and vomiting.

6. **Fluid and electrolyte imbalances** - Toxic kidneys disrupt normal balance of fluids and electrolytes in body, leading to symptoms such as dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., high potassium levels), and imbalances in acid-base levels.

7. **Swelling in the extremities** - Peripheral edema, characterized by swelling in hands, feet, or legs, can occur due to fluid retention.

8. **Back pain** - Flank pain or dull aching in lower back may be present and associated with toxic kidneys. Pain may be unilateral or bilateral.

9. **Confusion and cognitive changes** - Severe kidney injury can affect brain function and lead to confusion, cognitive impairment, difficulty concentrating, and even seizures in severe cases.

#### Extended Symptoms of Toxic Kidneys

- Fatigue or weakness
- Edema or swelling, especially in legs, ankles, or feet
- Blood in the urine
- Unexplained weight loss
- Nausea or vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Insomnia or difficulty sleeping

## User Testimonials

### Josh Macin - Detox Expert, United States

**Experience:**
"I did the Origin Kidney cleanse after months of going through different ZenCleanz protocols. Starting with Rainbow, done twice (with extended liver flush protocol each time), then 5 months on liquid enzymes with many days being solely on enzymes and water - I felt intuitively that my body was asking for the Origin Kidney cleanse.

The 30 days of the Origin Kidney cleanse coincided with a very intense and demanding time in my business. Longer working hours, tons of clients, inquiries, accounting and legal stuff.

However I was able to navigate through that challenging time very smoothly, the Origin kit gave me extra power (I felt supercharged!), I was able to keep up on a healthy sleep routine.

For nerds who love hard evidence - my hormone levels (E3G, LH, PdG) drastically improved."

### Maria - Acupuncturist, England

**Quote:**
"The continued results from clients with the mega dose enzyme cleanse is astounding. Need to keep sharing with you all."

**Experience:**
"This one day colon cleanse is one of the most effective ways i've seen to clear Damp. It usually takes a lot of treatments (acupuncture) to do what that cleanse did in 24 hours without much discomforts..."

**Key Takeaway:**
"IT IS LIKE AUTOPHAGY ON STEROIDS"

### Ross J Barr - Integrative Medicine Doctor, Belgium
