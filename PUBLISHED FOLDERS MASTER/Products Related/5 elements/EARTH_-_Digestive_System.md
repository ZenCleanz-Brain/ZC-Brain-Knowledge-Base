## Introduction

The ZenCleanz Way is a 6-month detox and rejuvenation schedule designed to transform your life. It is divided into six bundles, each approximately one month long. Each bundle is designed to help you gradually dig deeper into the toxicity of the various drainage pathways and layers of tissues of the body while constantly caring for upstream sources of filtration and intoxication.

---

## Layer 1: Earth - Digestive System

### Understanding Toxin Entry and Accumulation

We gradually become intoxicated following main entry points:
- **The intestines**
- **The lungs**
- **The skin**

From these entry points, toxins penetrate the bloodstream and are carried through three primary filters:
1. **The liver** (receives the most significant load of toxins)
2. **The lymphatic system** (absorbs toxic particles that cross the first barrier)
3. **The kidneys** (receives toxins when the lymphatic system becomes overloaded)

### The Truth About Detoxification

There is no magic pill. It takes decades to accumulate toxicity in the body. When the body calls for help, it's because it can no longer cope with the accumulated toxicity. At this point, toxemia has penetrated deeply into organs and tissues and interferes with their metabolic functions.

---

## Traditional Chinese Medicine Perspective

According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the digestive system is the root of the body's overall health and well-being. The digestive system is crucial in distributing **Qi** (vital energy) that flows through the body's energy pathways.

### Key Functions in TCM:

- **The Spleen**: Transforms food into Qi and blood
- **The Stomach**: Breaks down food into basic components
- **The Liver**: Regulates Qi flow, stores blood, and produces bile (aids digestion and maintains intestinal pH balance for healthy gut flora)

### The Triple Burner

The Triple Burner is a functional system that coordinates digestive, respiratory, and urinary system activities. It is divided into three parts:

- **Upper Burner**: Encompasses the lungs and heart
- **Middle Burner**: Includes the stomach, spleen, and liver
- **Lower Burner**: Comprises the bladder, kidneys, and genitals

### Digestive Imbalances

Imbalances in the digestive system manifest as:
- Bloating
- Constipation
- Diarrhea
- Acid reflux
- Ulcers
- Food allergies

TCM practitioners use dietary recommendations, acupuncture, herbal remedies, and lifestyle modifications to restore digestive balance.

---

## Naturopathic Medicine Perspective

According to naturopathic medicine, cleansing the intestinal tract from mouth to anus is essential because:

1. It is the entry point of external energy drawn through food (small intestine)
2. It is the primary sewage system of the body

### Mucoid Plaque Formation

Gradually since birth, we've been eating, digesting, and expelling feces—but not all. The small intestine functions as the gateway between food and blood. Along this tract:
- Food is broken down into nutrients
- Exchange happens with the bloodstream
- Clogging creates malabsorption and weakens overall energy and health

Like a sewage pipe, accumulated waste gradually accumulates along the intestinal lining, creating **"mucoid plaque."** This blocks the intestinal tract and creates toxic backups in the system.

---

## Anatomy & Physiology of the Digestive System

### Structure

The digestive system consists of several organs:
- **Mouth**: Where digestion begins as food is broken down by chewing and mixed with saliva containing enzymes that break down carbohydrates and starches
- **Pharynx and Esophagus**: Transport food to the stomach through peristalsis (muscle contractions)
- **Stomach**: Mixes food with stomach acid and digestive enzymes; regulates food release into the small intestine
- **Small Intestine**: Where most nutrient absorption occurs; lined with villi and microvilli that increase surface area for absorption
- **Liver, Gallbladder, and Pancreas**: Secrete digestive enzymes and bile aiding in fat and nutrient breakdown
- **Large Intestine (Colon)**: Absorbs water and electrolytes; forms feces for elimination
- **Rectum and Anus**: Store and eliminate feces

### Physiology

The digestive process involves coordination of:

1. **Motility**: Movement of food through the digestive system via muscular contractions
2. **Secretion**: Release of digestive enzymes and substances aiding food breakdown
3. **Absorption**: Transfer of nutrients into the bloodstream via villi in the small intestine
4. **Regulation**: Hormonal and nervous signals controlling digestion timing and coordination

---

## Why Cleansing?

### Common Causes of Digestive System Clogging

- Overeating
- Sedentary lifestyles
- Incorrect food combinations
- Insufficient chewing
- Food filled with chemicals

All lead to **BACKUP** in the system.

### Symptoms of a Clogged Digestive System

1. **Constipation**: Most common symptom; waste stays in colon too long, becomes hard and difficult to pass

2. **Diarrhea**: Body attempts to flush blockages by increasing water in bowel movements

3. **Bloating and Gas**: Gas buildup in stomach and intestines

4. **Abdominal Pain**: Accumulation of waste in the colon; can be sharp or dull

5. **Nausea and Vomiting**: Digestive system cannot process food properly; food ferments in tract

6. **Headaches**: Toxins accumulating due to impaired digestion

7. **Skin Problems**: Toxin accumulation leads to rashes, acne, and eczema

8. **Bad Breath**: Waste materials stagnate, releasing foul-smelling gases

9. **Fatigue**: System constantly active; body struggles to absorb nutrients, leading to deficiencies

---

## ZenCleanz ONE - The Flagship Intestinal Cleanse

### Overview

ZenCleanz **ONE** is a revolutionary digestive system cleanse that addresses mucoid plaque accumulation from the mouth to the anus in **one day**.

This power-packed plant-based fermented enzyme cleanse contains only all-natural, chemical-free ingredients. It is composed of three products:
1. **Ambrosia** (liquid)
2. **Intestinal Management** (powder)
3. **Fiber Crystals** (tablets)

### What It Does

Together, these enzymes:
- Clear long-term intestinal plaque (underlying source of most modern illnesses)
- Discharge old waste
- Absorb and expel toxins from intestinal walls
- Regulate and restore intestinal flora
- Improve food absorption, leading to better cellular nutrition

---

## Traditional Cleansing Methods vs. ZenCleanz ONE

---

## How the ZenCleanz ONE Works

### Before the Cleanse

- **No need to fast** before the ONE intestinal cleanse
- *No matter what you eat the day before, you will have results; enzymes will still work*
- **Maximize effect**: Eating lightly for many days before helps calm the mind, reduce inflammation, and boost effectiveness
- **Optional preparation**: Minimize food intake; avoid heavy proteins (meat, beans, nuts) that require more digestion

### During the Cleanse

- Mucoid plaque cleanse takes one day by taking kit enzymes at timed intervals
- **You won't feel hungry** when performing the ONE kit, as enzymes are food
- ZenCleanz liquid enzymes will keep you quite full
- Self-care protocols are included in the day's schedule
- Focus on abdominal massage, stretching, self-awareness, and letting go of surfacing emotions
- Focusing on breath and center is helpful when cleansing responses arise
- You can also use heating pad, warm baths, and rest
- **Cleansing is a wonderful time to focus on self-care**

### After the Cleanse

- Mucoid plaque is typically eliminated the following day (day 2), with some eliminating on day 3
- **If you begin eating right after the cleanse, enzymes will stop cleansing and move into digestion mode**
- Maintaining a fasting state and liquid diet for a few days encourages release of more mucoid plaque
- After you've eliminated plaque, begin eating lightly
- Suggested foods: fruit, soups, salads, and easily digestible foods

---

## How Natural Enzyme Blends Cleanse the Digestive System

### The Role of Enzymes

Enzymes play a vital role in the digestive system. They are responsible for breaking down food into smaller molecules that the body can absorb and use. Beyond normal digestive functions, enzymes can cleanse the digestive system.

### Enzyme Cleansing Mechanisms

1. **Improving Nutrient Absorption**: Enzymes remove mucoid plaque blocking nutrient absorption and break down foods into nutrients for blood absorption

2. **Reducing Inflammation**: Enzymes have anti-inflammatory properties, reducing inflammation in the digestive system and promoting healing

3. **Breaking Down Toxins**: Enzymes break down toxins in the digestive system, allowing the body to eliminate them more effectively

4. **Supporting Colon Health**: Enzymes clean the colon from plaque by breaking down waste material, nourishing flora, and promoting regular bowel movements

### Cellular Impact

Every organ, every tissue, and all 100 trillion cells in the body depend upon metabolic enzyme reactions and their energy factor. Nutrition cannot be explained without describing enzymes' role.

### Usage Questions

**Will the ONE cleanse get out all of my plaque?**

It may take many intestinal cleanses to clear enough accumulation to repair nutrient absorption. The amount varies from person to person. Once intestinal tract is cleared, along with continual liver flushing, perform ONE intestinal flush yearly for maintenance.

**I have severe constipation; will the ONE cleanse fix it?**

If you have intestinal inflammation issues such as chronic constipation, lower inflammation before beginning. 

Recommendations:
- ZenCleanz Mycelia liquid enzyme (powerful anti-inflammatory)
- Quantum Particles digestive enzymes
- Black Vacuum intestinal alkalinizer

Prepare with these for one month in advance.

Long-standing constipation signals liver congestion. To resolve:
- Pursue clearing and restoring liver function
- Repeatedly clear intestinal plaque
- Clear and restore liver function
- This restores alkaline intestinal pH, peristalsis, and absorption

**May I take supplements or medication while on the intestinal cleanse?**

Only take absolutely life-saving medication during the kit day. Pause all supplementation until you resume eating.

**I'm not used to fasting. What if I get hungry?**

You're unlikely to be hungry; people report feeling quite full. Fasting is an opportunity to explore unconscious feelings below hunger sensation. Explore how much of hunger is emotional and a state of feeling empty.
