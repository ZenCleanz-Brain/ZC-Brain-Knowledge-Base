## Overview

### The 5 Element System Philosophy

We slowly get intoxicated following the main entry points: the intestines, the lungs, and the skin. From there, the toxins penetrate the bloodstream and, carried by the blood, go through three primary filters:
- **The liver** - receives the most significant load of toxins
- **The lymphatic system** - absorbs toxic particles that have crossed the first barrier
- **The kidneys** - receives toxins when the lymphatic system is overloaded

Due to their detoxification functions, these organs gradually become saturated with impurities and require support.

### The ZenCleanz Way

The ZenCleanz Way is a 6-month detox & rejuvenation schedule divided into six bundles, each designed for approximately one month. Each bundle helps gradually dig deeper into the toxicity of various drainage pathways and layers of tissues while constantly caring for upstream sources of filtration and intoxication.

**Important Truth:** There is no magic pill. We take decades to get intoxicated. When the body calls for help, it is already because it can't cope with the level of toxicity accumulated over the years. At that point, the body truly requires deep detox work.

### Revolutionary Approach to Blood & Lymph Cleansing

Besides external hands-on techniques and dietary elements, there hasn't been any powerful protocol offered to humanity to address cardiovascular purification despite it being the leading disease and cause of death.

**ZenCleanz Solution:**
- Our enzymes are systemic and distinguished by their remarkable refinement
- They seamlessly infiltrate the bloodstream without any demand on the body
- Carefully chosen botanical components cleanse plaque accumulated on blood vessel walls
- They break down unwanted particles coursing through the circulatory system
- They aid in expulsion of toxins from the lymphatic system
- They participate in formation of new blood vessels and collagen synthesis
- Fiber-rich ingredients maintain digestive tract health and nurture gut flora

## Traditional Chinese Medicine & Naturopathic Medicine

### Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Perspective

#### Blood in TCM
- Considered an essential substance that nourishes the body and supports its functions
- Viewed as a **Yin substance** (fluid aspect), contrasting with Qi (Yang substance - energetic aspect)
- Healthy blood flow is crucial for overall health and well-being
- Provides nourishment to tissues and organs
- Supports the immune system
- Regulates body temperature, moisture balance, and hormonal balance

**Liver-Blood Connection:**
- Blood is closely linked to the liver
- The liver is responsible for storing and releasing blood into the body's circulation
- When liver functions correctly, blood flows smoothly and evenly
- Liver imbalance can lead to circulation problems, menstrual irregularities, and anemia

**Blood Deficiency (Xue Xu):**
- A common condition with various symptoms
- Symptoms include: pale complexion, fatigue, dizziness, and dry skin
- Often treated with acupuncture and herbal therapies that nourish blood and support optimal blood flow

#### Lymph in TCM
- The lymphatic system moves fluids through the channels that Qi flows through
- When functioning correctly, waste and toxins are adequately eliminated
- Qi and blood flow remain smooth and robust
- When the lymphatic system stagnates, it leads to swelling, pain, and inflammation
- Closely linked with the body's Qi and blood circulation
- Crucial aspect of the body's immune defense

### Naturopathic Medicine Perspective

Naturopathy emphasizes the body's innate ability to restore itself. Two critical components are the circulatory systems: blood and lymph.

#### Blood - The Lifeline
- Central role in transporting essential nutrients, oxygen, and hormones to cells and organs
- Simultaneously removes metabolic waste and toxins through the kidneys

#### Lymphatic System - The Silent Purifier
- Filters and eliminates waste from the body through blood and kidneys
- Lymph nodes and spleen act as immune system hubs
- White and red blood cells combat infections and cleanse the lymph
- Well-functioning system contributes to the body's natural ability to recover and maintain balance

## Anatomy & Physiology

### Anatomy & Physiology of Blood

#### Structure
The blood is a vital fluid comprising several components:
- **Red blood cells (erythrocytes)** - disc-shaped cells that carry oxygen from lungs to tissues
- **White blood cells (leukocytes)** - help fight infection and disease
- **Platelets** - involved in blood clotting
- **Plasma** - yellowish fluid making up liquid portion of blood, carries hormones, proteins, and glucose

#### Functions
Blood performs several vital functions:

1. **Oxygen Transport** - Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to and carries oxygen to body's tissues

2. **Nutrient Delivery** - Carries nutrients (glucose, amino acids) from digestive system to body's cells

3. **Waste Removal** - Carries waste products (carbon dioxide, urea) away from cells to organs responsible for excretion

4. **Immune Defense** - White blood cells protect against infection and disease; platelets prevent excessive blood loss

5. **Hormone & Temperature Regulation** - Carries hormones throughout body, regulating various physiological processes including body temperature

### Anatomy & Physiology of Lymph

#### Structure
The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and organs consisting of:
- **Lymphatic vessels** - tiny, one-way tubes carrying clear fluid called lymph; similar to veins but with thinner walls and more valves
- **Lymph nodes** - small, bean-shaped structures acting as filters, trapping bacteria and viruses
- **Spleen** - located in upper-left abdomen, filters blood and removes old/damaged red blood cells
- **Thymus** - gland in chest producing and maturing T-cells (white blood cells essential for immune function)
- **Tonsils** - located at back of throat, produce antibodies to fight infections

#### Functions

1. **Fluid Balance** - Lymphatic vessels drain excess fluid from tissues and return it to bloodstream, preventing swelling and edema

2. **Immune Function** - Filters pathogens and foreign substances; lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and tonsils play essential roles in immune response

3. **Fat Absorption** - Lymphatic vessels play role in absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from small intestine

4. **Waste Removal** - Removes waste products and toxins from the body

5. **Movement Activation** - Body movements pump lymphatic system flow and movement throughout the body

## Why Cleanse

### The Cleansing Role of Circulatory System

The circulatory system (blood & lymph) plays a vital role in transporting oxygen, nutrients, and hormones. Cleansing the blood and lymph systems is imperative to creating balanced health. The blood receives waste products evacuated by the lymph.

To maintain homeostasis, it evacuates waste products and toxins through:
- Kidneys
- Liver
- Lungs

Other organs involved include:
- Skin
- Intestines
- Spleen
- Lymphatic system

### Most Common Symptoms of a Toxic Circulatory System

1. **Fatigue** - Feeling tired or lacking energy
2. **Frequent infections** - Increased susceptibility to infections or weakened immune response
3. **Swollen lymph nodes** - Enlarged lymph nodes that may be tender or painful
4. **Skin issues** - Acne, eczema, dry and itchy skin
5. **Digestive problems** - Bloating, constipation, other digestive disturbances
6. **Headaches** - Frequent or persistent headaches
7. **Joint pain** - Aching or discomfort in joints
8. **Fuzzy thinking** - Difficulty concentrating, cognitive fog, memory issues
9. **Muscle aches** - Generalized muscle pain or soreness
10. **Poor circulation** - Cold extremities or reduced blood flow to certain body parts

### Extended Symptoms of Toxic Circulatory System

- Swollen lymph nodes, especially in neck, underarm, or groin areas
- Fatigue or unexplained exhaustion
- Recurring infections, colds, or flu-like symptoms
- Skin problems such as acne or rashes
- Headaches or migraines
- Sinus congestion or nasal discharge
- Fluid retention and bloating
- Joint pain or stiffness
- Digestive issues (constipation, diarrhea, gas)
- Chronic pain or inflammation
- Brain fog or poor concentration
- Allergies or autoimmune conditions
- Chest pain or angina
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
- High blood pressure
- Leg pain or cramping, especially during exercise
- Tiredness or weakness in the legs
- Cold feet or hands
- Erectile dysfunction
- Dizziness
- Atherosclerosis or plaques forming in arteries
- Peripheral artery disease (PAD)
- Blood clots
- Stroke or heart attack

### Critical Fact
Taking steps to flush out accumulated toxins in the circulatory system is step 4 of the 5-Element Detox and Rejuvenation system. It ensures that the blood and lymph are clean, leading to a profound detox in which we can next address the hormonal system and kidneys.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What are some possible detoxification symptoms?

The FLOW Blood & Lymph cleanse helps cleanse the blood and lymph system and boost microcirculation. You will likely feel lighter and clearer as the 7-day cleanse progresses.

**You may experience detoxification reactions such as:**
- Fullness
- Aches or pains
- Skin eruptions
- Rashes

As the body begins to balance, remember that:
- Circulation will improve in stagnant areas
- Detoxification symptoms will always reflect the body's work toward balancing

#### Can a FLOW kit be done before an intestinal or liver cleanse?

Yes, however, we invite you to start at the beginning and clear the digestive system detox pathways first.

#### How can I maximize the benefit of this cleanse? Can I add extra enzymes to the FLOW kit?

You can maximize the benefits by:
1. Dry skin brushing before you take the invigorating drink
2. Getting into a sauna after the rushing feeling is over (if you have access to one)
3. If there is no sauna access, take a hot mineral bath

**Additional Tips:**
- Boosting circulation and lymph flow through dry brushing, then sweating is a great way to augment this cleanse
- One is always welcome to add other enzymes (liquid and sachets) to this cleanse
- Remember to spread enzyme intake throughout the day

#### May I do other cleanses at the same time?

The ZenCleanz 5 Element Detox kits can be layered together; however:
- When doing the ONE intestinal cleanse, focus only on that cleanse for that day
- After the intestinal cleanse, one may layer the other cleanse protocols on the same day
- If you begin with the ONE intestinal cleanse as a part of the RAINBOW cleanse, you can start layering the other 5 Elements Detox kits on day two
- Don't combine the different kits' enzymes, but spread enzyme intake throughout the day

#### What can I do to maintain what I have accomplished with the FLOW kit?

We suggest that those who have done the FLOW kit continue taking:
- ZenCleanse liquid enzymes
- Powders
- Pills

For daily maintenance to continue cleansing and nourishing cells systemically. Incorporating these energetic enzymes into a healthful lifestyle will go a long way in sustaining the work done and helping to prepare the body for further cleansing.

The maintenance products to assist with the FLOW kit are listed on the website.
