  - question: "What are the main categories of benefits provided by Ambrosia?"
    answer: "Ambrosia provides three main categories of benefits: detoxing properties that remove harmful substances and balance gut flora, nourishing properties through bioavailable nutrients and prebiotics, and healing properties that repair the gut lining and reduce inflammation."
  - question: "Which specific probiotics are included in Ambrosia?"
    answer: "Ambrosia contains Lactobacillus Acidophilus (LA063) and Bifidobacteria (BB14), which compete with harmful bacteria to reduce toxin-producing species and support microbial balance."
  - question: "How does the fermentation process enhance the effectiveness of Ambrosia?"
    answer: "The 3-year fermentation process enhances bioavailability of nutrients, improves the efficacy of probiotics and enzymes, and reduces anti-nutritional factors in raw ingredients for better gut tolerance."
  - question: "What ingredients in Ambrosia help with heavy metal detoxification?"
    answer: "Brown algae contains alginates that bind heavy metals and other toxins, facilitating their removal from the body through the digestive system."
  - question: "How does Ambrosia support gut lining repair?"
    answer: "Ambrosia supports gut lining repair through ingredients like avocado and sweet potato (high in healthy fats and fiber), and wolfberry and red dates (rich in antioxidants and polysaccharides) that soothe and promote cellular repair in gut tissues."

c. **Anti-Inflammatory:** Ginger reduces gut inflammation, easing digestion.

### Momordica Charantia (Bitter Melon) (3.)

a. **Liver and Gut Cleanser:** Stimulates bile production, aiding in the elimination of waste and fats.  
b. **Anti-Microbial:** Helps eliminate harmful bacteria and pathogens from the digestive tract.

### Brown Algae (4.)

a. **Heavy Metal Detox:** Alginates in brown algae bind heavy metals and other toxins, facilitating removal.

### Lactobacillus Acidophilus and Bifidobacteria BB14 (5.)

a. **Microbial Balance:** Compete with harmful bacteria to reduce toxin-producing species.

### Roselle (6.)

a. **Digestive Cleanser:** Its mild diuretic and laxative effects promote elimination of toxins.

## Nourishing Properties

### Prebiotics (7.)

a. **Apple, Coix Seed, and Yam Bean:** Provide soluble fiber and oligosaccharides that feed beneficial gut bacteria, encouraging microbial diversity.  
b. **Isomaltooligosaccharide:** A powerful prebiotic that enhances beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria.

### Rich in Micronutrients (8.)

a. **Vegetables (Pumpkin, Spinach, Asparagus, Cauliflower):** Deliver essential vitamins and minerals like magnesium, folate, and potassium to support gut repair and enzyme production.  
b. **Fruits (Strawberry, Mulberry, Mango):** High in antioxidants, protecting gut cells from oxidative stress.

### Amino Acids and Phytonutrients (9.)

a. **Black Beans and Soy:** Provide protein and essential amino acids that rebuild and nourish gut lining cells.  
b. **Lotus Root and Chayote:** Offer phytonutrients that promote gut motility and improve nutrient absorption.

### Herbal Enzyme Liquid (10.)
