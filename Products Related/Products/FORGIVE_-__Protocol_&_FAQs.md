  - question: "Do I need to fast before doing the ZenCleanz FORGIVE liver cleanse?"
    answer: "No, fasting is not necessary before the FORGIVE cleanse. However, eating lightly for several days beforehand can help lower inflammation and boost effectiveness."
  - question: "What should I expect to come out during a FORGIVE liver flush?"
    answer: "Most commonly you'll see greenish sandy matter consisting of fatty material mixed with toxic matter released from the liver. Unlike other methods, ZenCleanz flush comes out as yellowish mud rather than diarrhea, typically appearing the afternoon after the cleanse."
  - question: "Can I still do a liver cleanse if I don't have a gallbladder?"
    answer: "Yes, liver detoxing is still important without a gallbladder. Most stones actually form in the liver where chemical toxicity is present, and removing the gallbladder doesn't address the underlying cause of liver congestion."
  - question: "When can I eat after completing the FORGIVE kit?"
    answer: "You can begin eating a few hours after your last enzyme sachet drink the morning after. Start with fresh juice and fruit, then move slowly to heavier foods like soup or salad to avoid shocking your system."
  - question: "What are common side effects during the FORGIVE liver cleanse?"
    answer: "Common cleansing responses include bloating, gas, nausea, and headaches as the enzymes work on liver burdens. These symptoms pass quickly and can be managed with breathing exercises, heating pads, warm baths, and rest."

## The Power of Forgiveness

*"Forgive others and you will Heal yourself. Forgive yourself and you will enlighten your soul."*

Forgiveness is not about letting someone off the hook - it's about letting yourself off the leash.

It's about releasing what no longer belongs in your body, your mind, or your heart. When we hold onto resentment, blame, or shame, we carry a kind of invisible toxicity, it clouds our joy, drains our energy, and hardens our hearts. But the moment we choose forgiveness - gently, honestly, and fully – we begin to soften. We begin to heal.

To forgive another is to cut the thread that keeps you tied to past pain. It doesn't mean you forget. It means you no longer let it define you. In doing so, you reclaim your peace, your clarity, and your ability to move forward without dragging the weight of the past. But there is an even deeper forgiveness – one many shy away from: forgiving yourself.

We are so often taught to push harder, do better, be perfect. And when we fall short, we punish ourselves with silence, with guilt, with impossible expectations. But healing doesn't come from shame. It comes from remembering that we are still learning. Still worthy. Still enough. Self-forgiveness is the sacred return to your own heart. It's the moment you stop fighting yourself and begin meeting your wounds with understanding. It is not weakness – it is awakening.

At ZenCleanz, we believe true detox is not just physical. It is emotional, spiritual, cellular. When you release what your body no longer needs, you make space for light. When you forgive, you make space for love.

This is what it means to cleanse with intention. To let go – not only of waste – but of what weighs you down. Because to forgive is to free yourself. And in that freedom, your soul remembers its light.

## Guided Protocol for Deep Acknowledgement with the ZenCleanz FORGIVE

Today, you offer your liver what it rarely receives – deep acknowledgment. Through this sacred rhythm, you guide your body out of stagnation and into flow.

### Getting Started

Each intake is a conscious act. First pour lukewarm water into a jar, then add either a sachet or liquid enzymes in a tightly sealed jar. Shake it with intention - like you're waking up the enzymes — 5–6 firm shakes.

### Morning Flow

- [ ] **09:00 AM** | 250ml (8.5 oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #1 & #2
- [ ] **10:00 AM** | 30ml (6 tsp) HYGIEIA in 250ml (8.5 oz) lukewarm water
- [ ] **11:00 AM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #3 & #4
- [ ] **12:00 PM** | 30ml (6 tsp) HYGIEIA in 250ml (8.5 oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #5

### Afternoon Flow

- [ ] **14:00 PM** | 30ml (6 tsp) HYGIEIA in 250ml (8.5 oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #6
- [ ] **15:00 PM** | 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #7 & #8

### Evening Flow

- [ ] **17:00 PM** | 30ml (6 tsp) HYGIEIA in 250ml (8.5 oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #9

### Evening Ceremony: The Flush

**21:00 PM**

- Standing beside your bed, combine Flush Formula Bottles A & B in a tightly sealed jar. Shake vigorously for one full minute.
- Drink the mixture in one go; then lie down on your right side for 45 minutes to allow the release to begin.
- Drift into sleep. Let your body work in silence.

### The Morning After: Integration & Gentle Completion

- [ ] **06:00 AM** | 30ml (6 tsp) HYGIEIA in 250ml (8.5 oz) lukewarm water + Sachet #10
- [ ] **08:00 AM** | 30ml (6 tsp) HYGIEIA in 250ml (8.5 oz) lukewarm water

---

## Gentle Guidance & Intuitive Listening

- Please note: If you're finding that adding the Hygieia to the enzyme packet is too sweet or too much, take it with 250ml (8.5 oz) of lukewarm water at the ½ hour instead.

- If you would like, you may apply gentle abdominal massage, stretching, and rest – whatever brings your body into its presence. Propping your head/shoulders so they are above your feet may be helpful to prevent reflux when lying down on your right side after ingesting the flush formula.

- Day 2, at noon, you may begin eating light meals like warm soups, steamed vegetables, low sugar fruits, and anything that will contribute some fibers to sweep out the toxic matters you've just released from your liver.

- Be patient. Evacuations come when the body is ready. There is no rush. Transit time is unique to each person.

- If you need assistance, please reach out to our team on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/zencleanz

**This is more than a liver cleanse. It is a ceremony of renewal.**

A chance to feel lighter, clearer, and closer to your true rhythm.

Walk gently, Drink with awareness. Trust the process.

## Frequently Asked Questions and Other Considerations

### Important Information Before You Begin

**PLEASE NOTE:** It isn't necessary to fast before doing the Forgive Liver/Gallbladder cleanse. Eating lightly for many days before can help lower inflammation and boost the effectiveness of the cleanse. 

When performing the FORGIVE liver/gallbladder kit, you won't be hungry, the enzyme blends keep you quite full. The day after performing the FORGIVE kit, you can begin eating a few hours after your last enzyme sachet drink. Begin with fresh juice and/or fruit. Move slowly to heavier foods such as soup or salad. It is important to focus on eating light and healthily so to not shock your system. Remember, your body has gone through something extraordinary!

#### Liver Cleansing Responses Can Include:

Many symptoms of liver stagnation can occur when cleansing our liver and gallbladder. Symptoms are a reflection of our body's burden, but when cleansing, these symptoms are a reflection of the enzymes working on those burdens. 

It isn't uncommon to experience:
- Bloating
- Gas
- Some nausea
- Headache

These symptoms pass quickly as the cleansing process progresses. When cleansing responses arise, focusing on our breath and our center is helpful. One can also use a heating pad, warm baths, and rest. 

**Remember, your body is going through an extraordinary process!**

### Why should I do a liver cleanse?

Cleansing the liver can be one of the most important steps taken to a well-functioning healthy lifestyle. The liver is a filter responsible for eliminating anything from within the body that doesn't belong there. The liver regulates most chemical levels in the blood and excretes a product called bile. This helps carry away waste products from the liver. 

All the blood leaving the stomach and intestines passes through the liver. The liver breaks down and processes this blood, creating nutrients, and also metabolizes drugs into forms that are easier to use for the rest of the body (or that are nontoxic). 

#### More than 500 Vital Functions

More than 500 vital functions have been identified with the liver. Some of the more well-known functions include the following:

- **Production of bile**, which helps carry waste away, and break down fats in the small intestine during digestion
- **Production of certain proteins** for blood plasma
- **Production of cholesterol** and special proteins to help carry fats through the body
- **Conversion of excess glucose** into glycogen for storage (glycogen can later be converted back into to glucose for energy), and to balance and make glucose as needed
- **Regulation of blood levels of amino acids**, which form the building blocks of proteins
- **Clearing the blood** of drugs and other poisonous substances
- **Regulating blood clotting**
- **Resisting infections** by making immune factors and removing bacteria from the bloodstream
- **Clearance of bilirubin**, also from red blood cells. If there is an accumulation of bilirubin, the skin and eyes turn yellow

#### How the Liver Processes Waste

When the liver has broken down harmful substances, its byproducts are excreted into the bile or blood:

- **Bile byproducts** enter the intestine and leave the body in feces
- **Blood byproducts** are filtered by the kidneys, and leave the body in the form of urine

Doing a 1-day liver cleanse can help eliminate matter from within the body that doesn't belong there.

### What comes out during a liver cleanse?

No two releases are the same. Understanding what has been released from your body during and after a liver cleanse is important. It can help you with moving into a healthier way of life. 

#### How to Examine Your Results:

We recommend that you collect your bowel movements into a sieve that you previously placed in the toilet bowl. 

#### What You'll See:

**Most common:** A kind of greenish sandy matter. Most of what you see is fatty material mixed with the toxic matter that has been released from the liver, and you may notice bigger pieces as well.

**Gallstones:** If you use a very hot shower jet over this it will reveal dark green pieces, which are gallstones. You may have a few or hundreds of them.

#### When to Expect Results:

The results of your liver flush will be seen towards the following afternoon. You can find more information here about what to expect during your liver cleanse.

**📝 PLEASE NOTE:** The afternoon of your liver cleanse, you will have what seems like diarrhea but is not. This is a function of your bile ducts beginning to flush and is a very important part of your cleanse. It will stop after you take your liver flush drink. 

#### Unique to ZenCleanz:

Unlike other methods using Epsom salts, our liver flush doesn't come out like diarrhea but more as yellowish mud. Moreover, the toxic matter will not come out the next morning but more towards the afternoon.

---

### Can I eat during the liver cleanse?

This cleanse protocol provides all the vitamins, minerals, and enzymes you need for a natural detox. You will not feel hungry during the cleanse. The enzymes will absolutely fill you up and make you feel full throughout the cleansing protocol.

#### After the Cleanse:

The day after performing the FORGIVE kit, you can begin eating a few hours after your last enzyme sachet drink. 

**Breaking Your Fast:**

1. **Start with:** Fresh juice and/or fruit
2. **Move slowly to:** Heavier foods such as soup or salad
3. **Important:** Focus on eating light and healthily so to not shock your system

**Remember, your body has gone through something extraordinary!**

### Pre-Detox Considerations for Internal Inflammation

> **⚠️ IF THERE IS INTERNAL INFLAMMATION, PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING PROTOCOL BEFORE DOING A ONE, FORGIVE, RAINBOW PROTOCOL OR RAINBOW PLUS PROTOCOL.**

Consider taking the Mycelia liquid enzymes (or Lightseed if you have sugar issues), and the Gut Essentials (GE) - Black Vacuum, Quantum Particles, and Fiber Crystals to reduce internal inflammation. These can be taken for 3 to 4 weeks or longer. Start slowly by introducing one product at a time and monitor how your body responds for several days. After that, begin adding the other products in the same manner. Adjust the dosages or make changes as needed. Once symptoms shift and the person is comfortable going forward, the ONE or FORGIVE can be used. Sometimes, the FORGIVE is done before the ONE to improve the overall condition further.

#### Liquid Enzymes

The dosing for the Mycelia/Lightseed is two doses, separately, daily, at 25 mL/5 tsp with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water. Start with one dose and increase as the body adjusts.

#### The Gut Essentials

- The Quantum Particles can be taken away from food with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water daily.
- The Black Vacuum should be taken with 500 mL/17 oz of warm water away from food once or twice daily.
- The Fiber Crystals should be taken with 250 mL/8.5 oz of warm water in the evening before bedtime.
- Additionally, if one has issues with intestinal inflammation, it can be helpful to begin with a liver detox first.

### Additional Tips for Doing a FORGIVE Kit

#### Preparation

- Stop smoking and do not drink alcohol or caffeine for the duration of the detox.

- The enzyme detoxes are designed not to require much preparation to do them. Eating lightly for a day or two beforehand can be beneficial. Choose easily digestible foods such as soups, fruits, and steamed vegetables. Meat tends to take longer to pass through the digestive system. You will be detoxing for a day or more, so additionally, preparing your mind for being with the process is wise.

- Read through the entire checklist and frequently asked questions (FAQs) for the FORGIVE kit detox before attempting and follow the instructions carefully.

- Make sure that all the contents are in the kit. In the extremely rare instance that something is missing, contact customer care or the support team on Facebook or Telegram for more guidance on how to proceed.

- The packets are numbered. Lay out all packets and liquid enzymes in order of the schedule and numbering of packets. Set aside packet number 10 and one of the small bottles of liquid enzymes so you don't take them until the next morning. **PLEASE TAKE THEM IN ORDER.**

- The time frame suggested above is a guide. You may adjust the detox's starting time frame to meet your schedule.

- Keep a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing ~ the more details the better.

#### During and After

- You may drink more warm water or liquid enzymes throughout the day of the detox. Cool or cold water can shock the body, requiring energy to warm it. The warm water helps disperse the enzymes throughout an empty stomach to absorb them more quickly. **HOWEVER, take only sips of water within 2 hours of drinking the flush drink.**

- Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes, and check with your doctor if necessary.

- When using ZenCleanz enzymes with warm water, they provide whole foods that are abundant in electrolytes and deliver the necessary "charge" for the body's cells, making additional substances unnecessary during a detox.

- You'll find you're full from using the enzymes provided in the kit. If by chance you "feel" hungry, we encourage exploring how much of the hunger is emotional and a state of feeling empty. The feeling of emptiness contains much wisdom if we allow ourselves to explore it.

- This detox needs to be completed in one day. If you find you are struggling with completing because of nausea, try the suggestions outlined below including spreading out the enzyme packets, but the flush drink must be taken within roughly 3-5 hours of the last packet.

- Epsom salt (as used in other liver flushing methods) dilates bile ducts but is very acidifying and dehydrating, can be hard on the kidneys, and is not needed with this kit. The FORGIVE liver detox is revolutionary as the "easing enzymes" dilate the bile ducts without depleting the electrolyte balance and acidifying the body. ZenCleanz fermented enzymes provide the dilation needed for a flush while giving the body the support it needs.

- There is a required expiration date listed on each kit. If unopened, the kits will be usable long after the expiration date.

#### Added User Tips for the FORGIVE Kit

- Try to have as stress-free a day as you possibly can.
- Consider Witch Hazel, castor or coconut oil, and a bidet (portable works, too) for the anal "soreness."
- Set a timer to help keep the schedule.
- Some people like to drink their flush drink with a straw; however, it needs to be drank in its entirety, quickly.
- Take a packet of Quantum Particles (if you have additional sachets) right after the flush drink to help with the aftertaste and nausea. This is a detoxer's favorite.
- Do not use a castor oil pack on the day of the flush. However, one can be used any time after taking the flush drink.
- It's important to be gentle with yourself during this journey towards better health. There will be moments that feel challenging or less enjoyable, and that's completely okay. Remember to take a step back and remind yourself of the bigger picture, both before and during your drink. You're working towards a healthier you, and every step, even the tough ones, is part of that process.

### Help! Both of my flush bottles have the same label and so I have the same ingredients in both bottles. What do I do?

Please look very closely at the writing on the bottle labels and you will see there are differences in what is contained in each bottle. There are also stickers on the top of the caps, an A and a B. The labels will also correspond to the A and B stickers on the caps. If you are still in doubt, you can open up each bottle and smell them or take a tiny taste of each to know they are not the same.

---

### May I take Bottle A and Bottle B separately?

No, the contents of each bottle need to be taken together. When it is time to take the flush drink according to the schedule, pour the contents of each bottle into a separate container that has a lid, such as a mason jar; continue as outlined in the manual above.

---

### Why does liver flushing involve olive oil? It seems to be a lot of oil; may I split the dose or take less? May I take more?

Olive oil contains various components that support liver health and aid in its natural cleansing process, particularly polyphenols. Among these, "hydroxytyrosol" is a notable substance; it is a potent polyphenol known to help cleanse the liver. To learn more about the health benefits of olive oil, please search online for additional information.

All the oil in the kit should be taken at the same time as the lemon juice. It is important to know that the minimum amount of olive oil is 120 ml/4 oz, which is the amount in Bottle B. Additionally, the total amount of olive oil consumed should not exceed 240 ml/8 oz. You may add more oil to the drink, but many people prefer to add only an additional 30-60 ml /1-2 oz.

---

### Why does liver flushing involve lemon juice? May I split the dose or take less? May I take more?

The lemon juice stimulates gastric secretion including the liver. Lemon and grapefruit (white only) contain the elements that help both trigger and tonify the digestive process. Limes are good for the liver, however, for a flush, lemon has a stronger stimulation (kick) for liver than limes. In addition, lemons have an essential oil that helps repair the gut lining, for example, in the case of a leaky gut.

All the lemon juice in the kit should be taken at the same time as the olive oil. It is important to know that the minimum amount of lemon juice is 120 ml/4 oz, which is the amount in Bottle A. Additionally, the total amount of lemon juice consumed should not exceed 240 ml/8 oz. You may add more lemon juice to the drink, but many people prefer to add only an additional 30-60 ml /1-2 oz.

---

### How do we know the stones are not congealed olive oil? What happens to the olive oil?

There is debate about every health-supporting process in existence. There will always be those that say what is working to better your health isn't natural and doesn't work. Olive oil doesn't congeal at body temperatures. Furthermore, some liver-gallbladder stones are not hard, just congealed bilirubin and cholesterol.

Bile accumulates during fasting while taking enzymes to prepare for the flush. These enzymes dilate the bile ducts, allowing the olive oil to stimulate the liver to release bile and clear congestion. This bile flows into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, and the olive oil is absorbed and eliminated through bowel movements.

---

### Where do the gallstones come from? Where are the stones coming from if I don't have a gallbladder? If I don't have a gallbladder, can I still do a FORGIVE liver detox?

"Gall" means bile, "bladder" means a container, and "stones" means a concentration of matter. The gallbladder stores bile and, by extension, "gallstones." Most of the stones form in the liver, where most chemical toxicity is also present. This issue is primarily about space. It's important to remember that the liver stores bile in the gallbladder. However, simply removing the gallbladder does not address the underlying cause of its disease.

When we refer to "stones," we are describing balled-up matter. This aggregated matter contains everything around it, which is not ideal. Therefore, any congested organ will begin to accumulate matter within it.

Taking a look at a graphic of the internal organs (please search the internet) we can quickly see how massive the liver is in comparison to the gallbladder, and how the majority of toxicity and stones will be found in this enormous organ. So, yes, liver detoxing is important for those who do not have a gallbladder.

---

### I am getting a headache; I have heartburn; I am becoming nauseous. What if I vomit?

Detox headaches and heartburn are symptoms of toxins moving through the body/liver and will pass. Detox nausea can be from fear and/or indicating toxins moving through the liver. Focus on slow deep breathing exercises, rubbing on PC6, fresh air, and grounding the body to slow nausea. As a last resort, sipping ginger tea 30 min away from the enzymes may prove helpful. In the rare case of vomiting, if it is during the time of taking the packets, taking a break and spacing the time out a bit more between drinks is acceptable; be sure to take the flush drink about 2-3 hours after packet number 9. If vomiting happens after the olive oil/lemon juice flush drink, everything is fine if it stays "down" for about an hour.

---

### I read about people having diarrhea on this detox. Why do I have diarrhea?

On the day of your detox, you will be fasting while consuming powdered enzymes mixed with a significant amount of water, along with liquid enzymes. During this process, your body undergoes systemic detoxification, while the enzymes prepare your liver for flushing by dilating your bile ducts. What you may experience might feel like diarrhea, but we refer to it as "watery emissions." This is a normal sign that your detox is functioning as intended, leading to a successful flush, and should subside after you drink the flush mix.

**Note:** It's also common for gas to accumulate during the day of the detox, which can make passing it challenging. To avoid any mishaps on the day of the detox, it's advisable to be cautious with releasing gas, as it may lead to unintended "watery emissions" being expelled. Taking this precaution can help ensure a smoother experience. As many of our flushers exclaim, **"Do not trust the farts!"**

---

### What comes out with a FORGIVE liver flush?

The liver is the body's largest internal filter. It has been filtering everything your body has encountered since birth. Unlike other methods using Epsom salts, ZenCleanz FORGIVE liver flush release doesn't come out like diarrhea but more like yellowish mud and is an amalgamation of debris in the form of acids, chemicals, unhealthful cholesterol, undigested fat, old bile, gallstones, and sometimes even flukes/parasites.

---

### When will I see my releases evacuate? Is there anything I can do to help "move things along?" Will I see stones?

You may feel rumblings for the second day or longer, but most of what's been released from the liver happened after you took your flush drink the night before. Therefore, when you have an evacuation of the release depends on the transit time of your intestines. Most people evacuate the majority of their release in the afternoon after the detox. Sometimes, it can go into the second day after as well. Focusing on abdominal massage, deep breathing, and trusting the process can help. The enzymes work throughout the body, cleansing and nourishing all cells, so there's no need for concern even if very little is eliminated.

If you'd like, you can help things along by doing a warm water or coffee enema. Remember, if you do a coffee enema and want to examine your release, it will be stained. Intestinal massages are also helpful. If you're uncomfortable, try a castor oil pack; adding some heat to that can be quite soothing. If tolerated, you can also do a castor oil pack daily (but not on flush day); it supports your liver and gets bile flowing.

As for stones, they come when the liver is ready to release them. The enzymes prepare for the release, and the flush drink helps to push things out, but it's hard to tell what the liver will release each time; it's what's closest to the "door."

---

### I released some sandy/yellow mushy substance. What is it? What are the darker stones?

What you're seeing is sludge, which is very important to get out. Remember, the liver is a very dense organ, and it can hold many toxins - which is what sludge has, along with a lot of fat, mucous, etc. Darker stones and sludge indicate that they are older. Sometimes you may even see calcified remains.

---

### What if I don't have much of a release or nothing comes out?

The liver is the largest organ in our body and is very dense, with over 2000 miles of bile ducts. By using ZenCleanz enzymes, you are cleansing your body at a cellular level. This systemic approach benefits your overall health in the long term.

Some flushes seem more productive than others; however, they all work internally to move things forward, regardless of whether we have a substantial release. Each flush is different; each flush is successful. The flush does two things: It pushes things forward and down in the liver and moves things out of the liver. We tend to look to "stones" for satisfaction, but all of the toxicity released is important, not just visible liver-gallbladder stones. Liver flushing requires patience and consistency and should be part of a healthful lifestyle.

---

### May I take the FORGIVE kit while menstruating?

A woman's monthly cycle serves as a natural form of detoxification, so it is advisable to consider waiting until at least the third day of the cycle, or longer, depending on individual responses to the cycle, before starting any detox programs. Some women experience difficult periods and may choose to wait until their cycle has completely ended. Ultimately, this decision is a personal preference.

---

### May I do a ONE kit and follow it with a FORGIVE kit the next day?

We suggest a minimum of one-day between the intestinal and liver kits to begin releasing mucoid plaque.

- **Day 1:** ONE kit
- **Day 2:** release day
- **Day 3:** FORGIVE kit
- **Day 4:** release day

---

### Does the FORGIVE kill parasites?

The FORGIVE detox doesn't kill parasites. Parasites are only able to thrive in a stagnant environment. In addition to clearing mucoid plaque, doing the FORGIVE liver detox after the ONE intestinal detox helps to begin to alkalize the intestines through improved bile flow. Over time, continual detoxing and a supportive healthful lifestyle will help restore the digestive system's integrity and alkalinity, making the body an unwelcome environment for parasites.

---

### Are there any conditions where I should not do the FORGIVE kit?

**Yes. Renal Issues or Failure**

You should NOT do the FORGIVE kit due to the high volume of water. However, you can still cleanse and work on your intestinal and liver health using ZenCleanz liquid enzymes, such as Hygieia, Ambrosia, Mycelia, and Aztec, and sachets such as the Gut Essentials: Quantum Particles, Fiber Crystals, and Black Vacuum. If you have any questions, check with a medical professional.

---

### May I do the FORGIVE kit if I am pregnant or nursing?

#### PREGNANCY: No

The ONE, FORGIVE, FLOW, INSPIRE, Mycelia, Chi, Spark, and NattoBlast are not advisable for pregnant, or planning to be pregnant. However, the ORIGIN kit, all other liquid enzymes, and sachets are good for the mother and baby. Remember that ZenCleanz products are foods with 100% bioavailable nutrients that help cellular nutrition.

**NOTE:** If taking ZenCleanz liquid enzymes for the first time, starting after the third month of pregnancy is recommended. If you have been drinking enzymes before the pregnancy, you may continue to consume them throughout the pregnancy.

#### NURSING

ZenCleanz liquids, powders, and tablets are good to take while nursing; although the Spark would not be advisable.

The INSPIRE Kit is not recommended during nursing due to the potent herbs. The FLOW has the Spark which is not advisable. For the ONE, FORGIVE, and RAINBOW kits, they can be used at the discretion of the parents; alternative option: breast pumping prior to the detox to save milk to feed while on the detox can be done, while pumping and dumping during the detox.

---

## Other Things to Consider

- Taking ZenCleanz enzymes daily helps cleanse and nourish the body's cells on a systemic level, complementing more targeted detox kits. Incorporating these energetic enzymes into a healthful lifestyle significantly supports the ongoing benefits of detoxification and prepares the body for future cleansing efforts.

- All liquid enzymes provide the advantages of long-term fermented, completely pre-digested enzymes, ensuring 100% bioavailable nutrients that continuously break down layers of congestion in the body. Each liquid enzyme has a unique profile, so we encourage everyone to explore the properties of each one, select the enzyme(s) that resonate with them, and try a variety for optimal results. For the liver: Hygieia, Aztec, Gut Essentials, and Jîng tablets are recommended.

### Sample Schedule for System Maintenance

**This applies to any liquid enzymes:** 25-30 ml/5-6 tsp, 1-3x daily. Take in 250 ml /8.5 oz warm water. Take 30 minutes before or an hour after food.

**Scheduling enzymes:** We suggest spreading enzyme intake throughout the day, taking one enzyme at a time, and waiting an hour or more to take another enzyme dose.

- One 25 mL/5 tsp dose of liquid enzymes once or twice daily will provide supplemental support for the body.
- Taking 3 or more doses of liquid enzymes daily boosts the repair in the body to therapeutic levels.
- Daily doses of 90 mL /18 tsp and above can allow one to fast on and feel full. We do not recommend exceeding 200 mL/40 tsp, as it may lead to overstimulation.

## A Little Bit About ZenCleanz Products

- Since we ferment 152+ plants and work with small and big farmers all over the world, it is impossible to ask them all to get the Organic Certification.

Additionally, the factory is ISO 22000 and HACCP certified.

- All ZenCleanz products are fermented, for three years, except the FORGIVE flush drink, INSPIRE tea, and ORIGIN Jîng.
