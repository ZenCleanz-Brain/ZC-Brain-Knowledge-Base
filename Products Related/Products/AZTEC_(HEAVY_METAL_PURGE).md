### Rosa Roxburghii Tratt Fermentation Liquid

**Chelating Agents:**
- Rich in antioxidants such as vitamin C and polyphenols, it helps bind and neutralize heavy metals like lead, mercury, and cadmium, making them easier for the body to excrete

**Supports Liver Detoxification:**
- Boosts glutathione production in the liver, enhancing the detox pathways essential for heavy metal removal

**Anti-Inflammatory:**
- Reduces oxidative stress and inflammation caused by heavy metal accumulation, protecting tissues from damage

### Isomaltooligosaccharide

**Prebiotic Action:**
- Feeds beneficial gut bacteria, creating a healthier gut environment that can trap and eliminate heavy metals from the digestive tract

**Improved Excretion:**
- Promotes bowel regularity, preventing heavy metals from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream

**Gut-Liver Axis:**
- Supports the gut microbiome's role in reducing the toxic load processed by the liver

### Lactobacillus Acidophilus (LA1063)

**Sequestration of Metals:**
- Binds to heavy metals in the gut, preventing their absorption and facilitating their excretion through feces

**Immune Support:**
- Boosts immunity to counteract the immunosuppressive effects of heavy metal exposure

**Restores Gut Integrity:**
- Helps repair the intestinal lining, reducing leaky gut syndrome and the systemic spread of toxins

### Bifidobacterium Longum

**Metal Chelation:**
- Works synergistically with other gut bacteria to adsorb heavy metals and detoxify the digestive system

**Anti-Toxic Effects:**
- Protects against oxidative damage by promoting the production of beneficial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)

**Regulation of Inflammation:**
- Balances gut inflammation, reducing systemic inflammatory responses triggered by heavy metal toxicity
