  - question: "Does the Flow Bundle kill parasites directly?"
    answer: "No, the Flow Bundle doesn't kill parasites directly. Instead, it restores microcirculation and reduces stagnation. Parasites can only thrive in stagnant environments, so improving circulation and system integrity makes the body less hospitable to them over time."

## Opening Reflection

*"Courageously And Peacefully, Surrender With Your Eyes Closed. Enter The Flow Of Life."*

There is a current moving through all things - quiet, steady, alive. Whether we resist it or relax into it, the flow continues. But something shifts when we choose to surrender - not from fear, but from trust.

In a world obsessed with control, surrender can feel like weakness. But the Real Courage Lies In Softening. In unclenching the fists. In breathing into the unknown and saying, I am ready to be guided. To surrender with your eyes closed is not to be blind, it is to see with something deeper. It is to listen to the silent wisdom beneath the noise. To feel the river of life carrying you. Even when you don't know what's around the bend.

This isn't passive. It's presence. It's the grace to step forward without needing all the answers. To release the need to force and instead allow yourself to be moved. Moved by the rhythm that already lives in you. The same rhythm that guides the tides, the stars, the seasons. Life does not ask you to control it. It asks you to dance with it.

When you surrender, not only do you lighten your load, but you also unlock your natural resilience, your clarity, your calm. You remember that you are not separate from the flow, you are part of it. And the more you trust it, the more life begins to feel like home again. So, close your eyes, not to escape, but to come closer. Let go, not to fall, but to rise in a new way. Breathe. Soften. Trust. The flow knows. And you were never meant to fight it. You were born to move with it.

## Guided Protocol for Inner Rhythm with the ZENCLEANZ FLOW KIT

A rhythm. A ritual. A return to flow.

This is not just a protocol – it's a pulse. A gentle activation of your inner rivers. Every enzyme in your FLOW kit is designed to meet your body where it's at, helping restore microcirculation, dissolve circulatory stagnation, support lymphatic drainage, and reduce inflammatory load from the inside out.

### Get Started

There is no rigid clock. Simply choose times that harmonize with your rhythm and best fit your schedule. The following is a recommended order but do what is best for you. Remember, all enzymes work best on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before or 60 minutes after food.

---

### Morning: NATTOBLAST

Supports fibrin and plaque breakdown, vascular elasticity, and clean arterial flow. Stir, sip, and let it awaken your bloodstream like sunlight through branches.

---

### Mid-Morning: MYCELIA

A fermented mushroom complex supporting blood purification, immune balance, and inflammation modulation. Feel it ground you and infuse your system with the quiet wisdom of medicinal mushrooms.

---

### Mid-Afternoon: SPARK

Before your Spark, you may optionally give your lymph a gentle nudge - use a dry brush to awaken the skin and stimulate flow.

**Dosage:** Take 25ml (5 tsp). Pour into 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water and feel the inner fire build.

A microcirculation activator that enhances oxygen delivery and revives peripheral blood flow. You may experience a warming sensation, subtle pulsation, or enhanced circulatory presence. That is your body coming back online. It's working.

#### Various Sensations You May Feel

A warming sensation. Subtle pulsation. Increased peripheral awareness. Enhanced circulatory presence. Do not be alarmed. This is a natural product that restores microcirculation and oxygen delivery throughout the body.

- **Prefer to slow the ride?** Dilute with more warm water or sip the mixture over an hour or two.
- **Sensitive stomach?** Take with a light meal.
- **⚠️ NOT for use during pregnancy.**
- Do not exceed 25ml (5 tsp) daily.

Start small. Stay upright. And if you feel the urge to high-five the universe - go for it.

#### After the Rush

Help your body release what's moving.

Sweat it out in a sauna, hot bath, brisk walk, or gentle stretch combined with deep breathing and let the flow complete its cycle.

---

### Evening: NATTOBLAST

**NattoBlast - 1 Sachet**  
Pour into 250ml (8.5oz) lukewarm water

Let it carry you into the night with open vessels and quiet strength.

**This isn't just circulation - it's restoration. Flow is life. And now, you're moving with it.**

---

## Protocol Duration & Flexibility

FLOW can be used as:

- **7-day activation** - minimum activation phase to experience circulatory awakening
- **14-30 day restoration** - deeper protocol for comprehensive vascular and lymphatic restoration
- **Integration phase** - repeat or layer with Fire Element protocols for ongoing support

This protocol can be adapted based on sensitivity, goals, or depth of stagnation.

## Frequently Asked Questions and Other Considerations for the FLOW Kit

### Additional Tips for Doing a FLOW Kit

#### Preparation

- Stop smoking and do not drink alcohol or caffeine for the duration of the protocol.
- Endeavor to eat at consistent times and avoid eating after 7 pm.
- Emphasize foods that support circulation and lymphatic flow: bitter and astringent vegetables (beets, greens, broccoli), anti-inflammatory foods (garlic, onions, berries), and naturally sweet whole foods.
- Avoid salty, spicy, refined sugar foods, and all processed foods.
- Focus on alkaline foods/drinks and increase the number of vegetables or maintain a vegetarian diet, if possible.
- Drink at least 2 liters of clean warm water per day. Warm fluids support lymphatic movement and help disperse the enzymes throughout an empty stomach for optimal absorption. Cool or cold water can shock the body and require extra energy to warm.
- Keep a notebook journal dedicated to detoxing – the more details the better.
- There is a required expiration date listed on each kit. If unopened, the kits will be usable long after the expiration date.

#### During and After

- Optional lymphatic activation practices: Dry skin brushing before Spark blend, followed by sauna, hot mineral bath, or gentle movement (walking, rebounding, qigong, breathwork, chest-opening movement). These practices support but don't overload the already strong circulatory activation.

- We recommend doing the FLOW as a standalone for the first time, so that its effects on the body can be fully appreciated. Thereafter, feel free to add in other liquid enzymes, powders, and capsules.

- Users report feeling lighter and clearer. It is common to experience restoration responses, such as feelings of fullness, aches or pains, skin eruptions, or rashes, as your body begins to find balance. Keep in mind that circulation will improve in areas that have been stagnant, and any symptoms you experience are a reflection of your body working towards achieving balance and restoring microcirculation.

- Take any necessary medication at least 1 hour away from the enzymes, and check with your doctor if necessary.

- You may do back-to-back FLOW bundles.

### Additional Tips for the FLOW Protocol

1. Wear loose fitting clothing in layers when taking the Spark Blend.
2. Consider following the Spark Blend drink with another glass of warm water to ease the circulatory response.
3. Restoration is a beautiful time to focus on self-care.
4. Optional supportive practices during this protocol include:
   - Dry skin brushing
   - Sauna or hot mineral bath
   - Gentle daily movement such as walking, rebounding, or vibration plate
   - Stretching, Yoga, Qi Gong, and Tai-Chi
   - Chest-opening breathwork
   - Lymphatic drainage massage
   - Sleep 7-8 hours a night, more if needed

### Note on the Spark Blend

The Spark blend restores microcirculation and enhances oxygen delivery throughout the body. Please do not be alarmed. The ginger and pepper contained in this blend activate flow throughout the body. You may experience a warming sensation, subtle pulsation, increased peripheral awareness, tingling, redness, or a feeling of "fullness." These sensations may sometimes be intense but are common indicators of increased circulatory activity and typically pass within an hour or so. This is an opportunity to feel an expansiveness with the restored circulation and not a cause for alarm. Sometimes there are no noticeable reactions, but the blend is still working. After this time, you may also get a chill. This, too, is common and would be an excellent time to get into a sauna or hot mineral bath.

---

### May I take the FLOW while menstruating?

A woman's monthly cycle serves as a natural form of detoxification, so it is advisable to consider waiting until at least the third day of the cycle, or longer, depending on individual responses to the cycle, before starting any detox programs. Some women experience difficult periods and may choose to wait until their cycle has completely ended. Ultimately, this decision is a personal preference. Important to note that the FLOW increases blood flow, so if there are apprehensions about a possible increase while menstruating, wait until your cycle ends.

---

### Does the FLOW kill parasites?

The FLOW doesn't kill parasites directly. Parasites are only able to thrive in a stagnant environment. FLOW works by restoring microcirculation and reducing circulatory stagnation. In addition to restoring lymphatic and vascular health using the FLOW, doing the FORGIVE liver detox after the ONE intestinal detox helps to begin to alkalize the intestines through improved bile flow. The INSPIRE helps detox and strengthen the lungs, and the ORIGIN helps to strengthen and cleanse the kidneys. Over time, continual restoration and a supportive healthful lifestyle will help restore the system's integrity and alkalinity, making the body an unwelcome environment for parasites.

---

### Are there any conditions where I should not do the FLOW bundle?

If you are pregnant, or planning to be, or nursing. If you have any concerns, please consult your doctor or healthcare provider.

---

### May I do the FLOW if I am pregnant or nursing?

**No.** The Mycelia, Spark, and NattoBlast are not advisable for pregnant, or planning to be pregnant, or nursing women. Additionally, the ONE, FORGIVE, and Chi are not advisable for pregnant, or planning to be pregnant, women. However, the ORIGIN kit, all other liquid enzymes, and sachets are good for the mother and baby. Remember that ZenCleanz products are foods with 100% bioavailable nutrients that help cellular nutrition.

**NOTE:** If taking ZenCleanz liquid enzymes for the first time, starting after the third month of pregnancy is recommended. If you have been drinking enzymes before the pregnancy, you may continue to consume them throughout the pregnancy.

---

### Other Things to Consider

- Taking ZenCleanz enzymes daily helps restore and nourish the body's cells on a systemic level, complementing more targeted protocols. Incorporating these energetic enzymes into a healthful lifestyle significantly supports ongoing systemic restoration and prepares the body for deeper healing.

- All liquid enzymes provide the advantages of long-term fermented, completely pre-digested enzymes, ensuring 100% bioavailable nutrients that continuously support circulation and reduce congestion in the body. Each liquid enzyme has a unique profile, so we encourage everyone to explore the properties of each one, select the enzyme(s) that resonate with them, and try a variety for optimal results. For lymphatic and circulatory health, customers often choose any of the products in the FLOW kit which are all sold separately.

---

### A Sample Schedule for How to Take Enzymes for System Maintenance

- **This applies to any liquid enzymes:** 25-30 ml/5-6 tsp, 1-3x daily. Take in 250 ml /8.5 oz warm water. Take 30 minutes before or an hour after food.

- **Scheduling enzymes:** We suggest spreading enzyme intake throughout the day, taking one enzyme at a time, and waiting an hour or more to take another enzyme dose.

- One 25 mL/5 tsp dose of liquid enzymes once or twice daily will provide supplemental support for the body.

- Taking 3 or more doses of liquid enzymes daily boosts the repair in the body to therapeutic levels.

- Daily doses of 90 mL/18 tsp and above can allow one to fast on and feel full. We do not recommend exceeding 200 mL/40 tsp, as it may lead to overstimulation.

---

### A Little Bit About ZENCLEANZ Products

- Since we ferment 152+ plants and work with small and big farmers all over the world, it is impossible to ask them all to get the Organic Certification. Therefore, we test for over 200 substances after the process is over (heavy metals, bacteria, and chemicals like pesticides, herbicides etc.) Moreover, Taiwan's law forbids GMOs. Additionally, the factory is ISO 22000 and HACCP certified.

- All ZenCleanz products are fermented, for three years, except the FORGIVE flush drink, INSPIRE tea, and ORIGIN Jing.
