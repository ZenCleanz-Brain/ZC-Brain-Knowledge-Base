## Overview

### The Toxicity Entry Points

We slowly get intoxicated following the main entry points: the intestines, the lungs, and the skin. From there, the toxins penetrate the bloodstream and, carried by the blood, go through three primary filters:
- **The liver** - receives the most significant load of toxins
- **The lymphatic system** - absorbs toxic particles that have crossed the first barrier
- **The kidneys** - receives toxins when the lymphatic system is overloaded

Due to their detoxification functions, these organs gradually become saturated with impurities and require support. To help them efficiently, we must detoxify following the order in which they became impure.

### The ZenCleanz Way

The ZenCleanz Way is a 6-month detox & rejuvenation schedule divided into six bundles, each designed for approximately one month. Each is designed to help gradually dig deeper and deeper into the toxicity of various drainage pathways and layers of tissues while constantly taking care of upstream sources of filtration and intoxication.

**Important Truth:** There is no magic pill. We take decades to get intoxicated. When the body calls for help, it is already because it can't cope with the level of toxicity accumulated over the years. At that point, the body truly requires deep detox work.

### The Unique 3-Layer Lung Approach

Typically, the standard approach to cleansing the lungs is to provide expectorants. While beneficial, this primarily operates externally.

**ZenCleanz INSPIRE uses a unique 3-layer approach:**

1. **Internal Bloodstream Support** - A highly concentrated Chinese Medicine enzyme blend known for sensitivity to oxidation, packaged in small 5ml vials. Users administer it under the tongue and hold for a minute to facilitate direct absorption into the bloodstream.

2. **Digestive System Access** - Another blend in tea form which accesses the bloodstream through the digestive system.

3. **External Expectorant** - An expectorant syrup to help clear the mucus that may accumulate in the throat and lungs.

This holistic approach aims to deeply rejuvenate the body's organs, including the lungs, from within and without.

## Traditional Chinese Medicine & Naturopathic Medicine

### Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Perspective

#### The Lungs in TCM

The lungs are one of the vital organs within the body, responsible for the proper functioning of both the respiratory system and the energy system.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Associated with the element of **Metal**
- Often referred to as the **"Sovereign of Qi"**

#### Lung Functions in TCM

The lungs are believed to be responsible for:
- Intake of clean air and expulsion of waste gases
- Playing a vital role in circulation of Qi (life energy) throughout the body
- Governing the opening and closing of the pores (closely linked with the skin)
- **"Commanding Qi"** - the ability to regulate and control flow of Qi in the body

#### Meridian & Organ System Connections

- Connected to other organs through the meridian system
- Any imbalance or dysfunction in the lungs can affect the functioning of other organs and systems in the body

#### Emotional Connections

TCM considers emotions associated with each organ. For the lungs:
- **Emotions affecting lungs:** Grief and sadness
- **Effects of excess emotions:** Can weaken lung Qi and lead to respiratory problems
- **Resulting conditions:** Shortness of breath, coughing, asthma

#### TCM Recommendations for Lung Health

To support lung health and balance, TCM recommends:
- Deep breathing exercises
- Maintaining good posture
- Eating nourishing foods
- Avoiding excessive grief or sadness
- Herbal medicine
- Acupuncture
- Other TCM therapies to strengthen lung Qi
- Clear respiratory congestion
- Address imbalances or disorders related to the lungs

### Naturopathic Medicine Perspective

Cleansing the lungs is a key focus in naturopathic medicine.

#### The Process

This process aims to:
- Remove toxins and enhance respiratory health
- Reduce mucus buildup
- Strengthen the immune system
- Improve lung function
- Lead to better energy levels
- Reduce allergy symptoms
- Promote healthier and more vibrant life

#### Systematic Cleansing Philosophy

Naturopathic medicine places strong emphasis on systematically cleansing the body, as it is believed to have direct and indirect benefits for lung health.

A systematic cleanse, often involving various detoxification practices and dietary adjustments, can help remove toxins that accumulate in the body over time.

#### Benefits of Systematic Cleansing

This process not only aids in overall well-being but also specifically benefits lung health through:
- Reduced mucus and phlegm production
- Improved lung function
- Strengthened immune response against respiratory infections
- Reduced inflammation in the respiratory tract

By systematically cleansing the body, naturopathic medicine aims to create an environment conducive to optimal lung health, ultimately contributing to a vibrant and thriving state of well-being.

## Anatomy & Physiology

### Anatomy of the Lungs

The lungs are responsible for facilitating the exchange of gases between the body and the environment. They are located in the thoracic cavity on either side of the heart.

#### Lung Structure

**Lobes:**
- **Right lung** - Larger than the left, has three lobes (upper, middle, and lower)
- **Left lung** - Has two lobes (upper and lower)

This division allows for better accommodation of the heart on the left side of the thoracic cavity.

**Protective Membrane:**
- Each lung is enclosed by a double-layered membrane called the **pleura**
- Helps reduce friction during breathing

**Tissue Properties:**
- Spongy, elastic texture
- Highly vascularized
- Contains vast network of blood vessels

### Physiology of the Lungs

The anatomy and physiology of the lungs work together to ensure efficient oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide elimination essential for sustaining life.

#### The Breathing Process

**1. Inhalation**
- The diaphragm (dome-shaped muscle at the base of lungs) contracts and moves downward
- Intercostal muscles between the ribs contract
- Ribcage forces upward and outward
- Expansion of thoracic cavity lowers air pressure in the lungs
- Causing air to rush in through the nose or mouth

**2. Oxygen Exchange**
- Air moves into progressively smaller airways called bronchioles
- Reaches microscopic air sacs called **alveoli**
- Alveoli surrounded by network of capillaries
- Oxygen from inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream
- Oxygen binds to red blood cells

**3. Exhalation**
- Diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax
- Thoracic cavity decreases in size
- Pressure in lungs increases
- Air forced out through nose or mouth
- Exhaled air removes waste gases, primarily carbon dioxide

**4. Gas Exchange**
- Through diffusion, oxygen moves from alveoli into capillaries
- Carbon dioxide moves from capillaries into alveoli
- Facilitates transportation of oxygen to body's cells
- Removes carbon dioxide (waste product of cellular respiration)

### The Lungs in the Modern Environment

In the modern living environment, industries and smokers produce a large number of toxic substances in the air. This pollution makes human lungs and blood subject to a large degree of toxicity, causing a series of related diseases, thus endangering health and human life.

**Primary Lung Functions:**
- Absorb fresh oxygen
- Discharge carbon dioxide
- Exhaust gases the human body does not need

**Critical Importance:**
- Every important energy supply activity in the body requires oxygen
- Poor breathing can lead to various diseases
- Lungs are the most delicate organ in the human body
- Only organ directly connected with nature
- Very vulnerable to external toxicity that invades the body through this organ

## Why Cleanse

### Most Common Symptoms of Toxic Lungs

1. **Coughing** - Persistent cough that may produce phlegm or mucus
2. **Shortness of breath** - Difficulty breathing or feeling breathless, especially with physical exertion
3. **Wheezing** - High-pitched whistling sound during breathing, usually due to narrowed airways
4. **Chest pain** - Discomfort or aching in chest, possibly exacerbated by deep breaths or coughing
5. **Fatigue** - Feeling tired or lacking energy, often accompanied by reduced exercise tolerance
6. **Respiratory infections** - Increased susceptibility to respiratory infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia
7. **Cyanosis** - Bluish discoloration of lips, face, or extremities due to lack of oxygen
8. **Chronic cough** - Long-lasting cough persisting more than eight weeks, even after treatment
9. **Allergic reactions** - Development or worsening of allergies, such as allergic rhinitis or asthma
10. **Reduced lung function** - Decreased lung capacity, as measured by tests like spirometry, due to scarring or inflammation of lung tissue

### Extended Symptoms of Toxic Lungs

- Smokers
- Sore throat or hoarseness
- Nasal congestion or chronic runny nose
- Headaches, dizziness, or confusion
- Chest congestion or phlegm production
- People living in polluted areas
- Allergy-like symptoms (itchy or watery eyes, sneezing, coughing)
